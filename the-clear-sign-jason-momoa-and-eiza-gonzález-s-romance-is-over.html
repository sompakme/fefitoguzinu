That relationship was put to bed in February when she was photographed on a date with NBA player Ben Simmons in New York City. According to a <a href=#>Page Six</a> source, the two had been together for several months. "They've been hiding and trying not to get seen [together]," the insider told the outlet. "They weren't alone [for the dinner], but they are very clearly together," they added. That was the last time the "Ambulance" star was seen with Simmons, but in the summer she was photographed on a yacht with Lewis Hamilton and friends. Speculation rose that González could be dating the F1 racing star, but that was never confirmed.</p><p dir=ltr>In October, photographs seemed to confirm that González had found a new beau. Pictures obtained by <a href=#>HOLA!</a> showed González wrapping her arms around and kissing Spanish actor Mario Casas. Even González's mother, Glenda Reyna, weighed in on the situation. "He is handsome. We have good taste in the family," Reyna told <a href=#>HOLA!</a> on November 23 when speaking about Casas, although she could not confirm that her daughter was dating the actor. González's mother was open to the idea of her daughter tying the knot. "If she is in love and they give each other a ring ... I will be thinking about the dress," she joked. While González had clearly moved on, Momoa remained single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlaoR2go6co56ZomLAqrPNZqGaq5%2Bjeq67zKiYZp2Zr65us86nsZqkla96s7vMmqWcnV2kw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarfo-da-plug-has-passed-away-asian-doll-24hrs-more-share-tributes.html><span>←</span><span>Scarfo Da Plug Has Passed Away: Asian Doll, 24Hrs &amp;amp; More Share Tributes</span></a>
