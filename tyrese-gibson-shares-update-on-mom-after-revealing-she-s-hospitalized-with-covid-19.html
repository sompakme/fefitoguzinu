During an <a href=#>Instagram Live</a> from the hospital, <a href=#>the "Baby Boy" star shared</a> that his mother was still in an induced coma but that she is "getting better every day" and her vitals were good. "The Lord Jesus Christ is responsible for every breath that I see entering into my mom's body right now," the actor explained. Gibson sat outside her room as he addressed his fans about her health, their relationship over the years, and even encouraged people to call their loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>He also revealed that he could only spend 30 minutes at a time inside her room. Even though his mother is unable to respond, he walked in and gave her words of encouragement: "Mom, I love you. You got people around the world praying for you. Thank you for everything you've ever done for me mom."&nbsp; Before signing off of his Live, he thanked everyone for their prayers and the outpouring of support he's been receiving.&nbsp;"I owe you guys," he emotionally reflected. "Let's just hope that she gets out of this bed. ... I got so much more to do, Ma."</p><p>While Gibson and his mother haven't always had the best relationship, he has frequently voiced his support for her on social media. In 2017, he revealed that he <a href=#>bought her a house</a> to celebrate 11 years of her sobriety. Here's hoping Gibson gets to spend much more time with his mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5gbYB0e9OyqZ6rlWK0qq7SqKVmq5iWv6a%2FjK6nnZmkmnqwuoympqZlkZvBpr6Mq5yvnZGhtq%2BzjKyfnqtdnby0vMitmKWhqpqxbsPIrZ9mm5%2BrtqV5kHJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rooney-mara.html><span>←</span><span>Rooney Mara</span></a>
