This seems doable, but his additional demands are a little off the wall.</p><p>Ok @RobertStoneWWE my man! Let’s collab. Get me a match vs @FinnBalor at Takeover, I only want fuschia m&m’s(they don’t make those, so figure it out), ideas on someone to help me cosplay the pic below, crushed velvet furniture on my bus, oh yeah a bus(everyone has em now) etc etc</p><p>We’ll have to see if Edge and Robert Stone can make something work. The former Robbie E might need to get to work on Edge’s demands first.</p><p>Edge is currently out of action with an injury. He will be back and has several matches left in his current contract. Perhaps a contest against Finn Balor isn’t out of the question, but Robert Stone likely won’t have much to do with making it happen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
