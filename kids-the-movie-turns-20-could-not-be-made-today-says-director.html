Twenty years after its release at that same theater, the room was crowded with now grown-up members of the original cast — including Leo Fitzpatrick, who played the lead character, Telly.
“Besides the sex and the AIDS, I didn’t understand why Kids was considered so shocking,” the graying actor said in his thick New Jersey accent during a boisterous Q&A session after the screening."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the next scene, Telly and his best friend Casper (the late <strong>Justin Pierce</strong>) walk the streets of New York, stealing beer and peaches from a Korean grocery. Telly’s obsessed with girls, the younger the better. He has his eye on 13-year-old Darcy (<strong><span data-scayt_word=Yakira data-scaytid=2>Yakira</span> <span data-scayt_word=Peguero data-scaytid=3>Peguero</span></strong>). As they walk down a block, Casper stops and takes a piss right on the sidewalk.</p><p>“That was our daily life,” Fitzpatrick explained. “We were kids and <span data-scayt_word=skateboarders data-scaytid=5>skateboarders</span>. Larry thought we were interesting. It gave me self-worth that I didn’t have before.”</p><p>Telly and Casper head up to an apartment filled with boys smoking blunts and doing whippets. While they talk about sex, girls in a nearby apartment do exactly the same. It’s a terrific bit of call and response.</p><p>Two of the girls in that scene —<strong> Chloe <span data-scayt_word=Sevigny data-scaytid=6>Sevigny</span> </strong>and <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong> — went on to have major acting careers. (Due to previous commitments, neither was able to attend the screening.) They go to a clinic where Jenny (<span data-scayt_word=Sevigny data-scaytid=7>Sevigny</span>) learns she has HIV from having unprotected sex with Telly.</p><p>“The hook was Jenny had AIDS,” Clark offered. “She was like the maiden on the railroad tracks. Casting Jenny was the hardest. I casted Chloe three days before shooting.”</p><p>Born in Connecticut, <span data-scayt_word=Sevigny data-scaytid=8>Sevigny</span> had moved to New York, where she worked at a rave shop, Liquid Sky, and soon met budding screenwriter <strong>Harmony <span data-scayt_word=Korine data-scaytid=10>Korine</span></strong>, who penned the script for Kids. They later became a couple.</p><p>As Jenny searches for Telly, the boys congregate in Washington Square Park, where they hurl insults at gays and rabidly beat-down an African American denizen of the park. It’s among the most violent scenes in the film.</p><p>This is where Clark met and bonded with the skaters that would eventually appear in the movie. Prior to making Kids, he was a photographer and a drug addict. “I always wanted to make a film,” the director said. “I wanted to make a movie that wasn’t about me, that I knew nothing about. I was 47. I cleaned myself up. I had learned to skate. I hung out with the skaters for three to four years. I wanted to make a film that was age appropriate. The parties, the drinking, the fighting, the f—<span data-scayt_word=ing data-scaytid=14>ing</span> — everything.”</p><p>After meeting <span data-scayt_word=Korine data-scaytid=15>Korine</span> in the park, he offered the neophyte the opportunity to write the script. “It took Harmony three weeks,” Clark recalled. “It was brilliant writing. That’s how it happened.”</p><p>While most of the characters have little redeeming value — the movie is <span data-scayt_word=bookended data-scaytid=17>bookended</span> by a disturbing rape scene — the goal of the movie was to truly represent a moment in time in New York when skate punks merged with hip-hop kids and formed an unusual bond. Many of the players were from broken homes with little parental guidance; they were wild children driven to explore the seedier side of New York life.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>To a person, everyone on the panel agreed that a movie like Kids could never happen today, for a variety of reasons, but mostly due to the gentrification of the city. “We shot it in 1994,” Clark pointed out. “A couple of years later, it never could’ve been made.”</p><p><strong>Ronald Hunter</strong>, brother of Harold&nbsp;<span>—</span>&nbsp;the film’s main African-American character&nbsp;<span>—</span>&nbsp;contended that “this generation doesn’t really have a culture.” Sadly, Harold died of a drug overdose in 2006, six years after Pierce committed suicide in a hotel room in Los Angeles. Fans of Next Friday will remember him in the role of Roach.</p><p>The 20-plus year saga of&nbsp;Kids, including those who inspired the story and its aftermath, is being documented in <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Kids</a>, directed by<strong> Hamilton Harris</strong>, who was on hand to help lead the Q&A and show a teaser of his upcoming film.</p><p>As far as Clark, he’s since made such films as Bully, Another Day in Paradise and <span data-scayt_word=Wassup data-scaytid=21>Wassup</span> Rockers. In 2012, <span data-scayt_word=Korine data-scaytid=20>Korine</span> wrote and directed Spring Breakers, which has a lot in common with Kids. Fitzpatrick also starred in Bully, Clark’s take on Florida youth culture.</p><p>Why the fascination with youth culture? “I had an unhappy childhood,” Clark ventured. “It just kind of became my territory.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKy1w6xkpqemnrJuwNSrpaxlYmV6pLvUpZtmcGBugnOFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyrese-gibson-shares-update-on-mom-after-revealing-she-s-hospitalized-with-covid-19.html><span>←</span><span>Tyrese Gibson Shares Update On Mom After Revealing She's Hospitalized With COVID-19</span></a>
