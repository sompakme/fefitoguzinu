Blonde comes in dozens of iterations, from strawberry blonde and honey blonde to caramel blonde and buttercream blonde—and many, many other shades that don't sound quite as delicious (but still look gorgeous). It's not just a light-to-dark spectrum, either: Blonde hair can veer towards white, yellow, red, brown, orange and rose gold tones, and manages to look completely different every time. It's easily the most versatile hair color (if you can even call it a single color), because it lends itself beautifully to so many different tones and textures.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bill Murray's March sadness becomes instant internet meme</h2><time>Jul 11, 2024</time>
