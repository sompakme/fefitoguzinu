<a href=../../why-aaron-taylor-johnson-changed-his-name-after-getting-married.html></a>
Most celebrities don't bother changing their names — or at least their stage names — when they marry, but Aaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson begged to differ. And instead of Sam merely taking Aaron's last name, the couple decided to combine each other's surnames.
"I just don't see why women need to take the man's name," Aaron told the London Evening Standard in 2012. "I wanted to be a part of her just as much as she wanted to be part of me.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Will &amp;quot;Joker&amp;quot; Be In New &amp;quot;Suicide Squad&amp;quot; Movie?

These days, with Joker being the number-one movie in the country for two straight weeks, it’s easy to see the popularity the green-haired villain has garnished over the years. Back in 2016, Suicide Squad featured the villain, played by Jared Leto. However, fans may be disappointed to know that Joker probably won’t be in the second edition of the Suicide Squad story.

We are inching closer to Fastlane 2023 by the minute. The creative team has booked five blockbuster matches for the show. While many are looking forward to walking out of the upcoming Premium Live Event with a win, others may be working on devious plans.
Here, we look at the four biggest betrayals that could transpire on WWE Fastlane 2023. So, without further ado, let's begin:
#1 John Cena betrays LA Knight John Cena is set to team up with LA Knight to take on The Bloodline's Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>WWE Releases About To Explode Free Agency Market Wide Open As Non-Compete Clauses Expire</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
<a href=../../wwe-releases-about-to-explode-free-agency-market-wide-open-as-non-compete-clauses-expire.html></a>
WWE released a lot of people over the last year. They fired over100 people from their corporate HQ, and they followed that up with roster cuts. Now, that last batch of WWE main roster releases are hitting the free agent market.
In September, WWE made the decision to release a number of talents, but they were not allowed to compete elsewhere. WWE’s non-compete clause kept them from getting right out there to compete.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>$35,000 a Year Is How Much an Hour?</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../35-000-a-year-is-how-much-an-hour.html></a>
When it comes to working out someone’s salary, the annual figure is often the first thing that comes to mind.

The Ahmad Arbery killing may have occurred back in February, but it's picked up steam within the last few weeks. The 25-year-old Georgia resident was jogging when he was followed by father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael—now reportedly for four to five minutes around his neighborhood—before they shot and killed him on the road. The McMichaels argued that Ahmaud was a suspect in neighborhood robberies so they went to make a citizen's arrest and he resisted, resulting in his death.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chuck Klosterman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
