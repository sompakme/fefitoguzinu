A touch of poison seals my fate!
(The dawn echoes the night with my glory)
The sun himself honors meOnce king of roses, now lord of gold
(Blessed with the gift of gilded touch...)

I curse the day my dream became my descent
Suddenly I long for you, my only love
In my perfection I have no want</article><article class=post-entry><h2>90 Day Fiances Mary DeNuccio shares tearful post following pregnancy announcement: I hate myse</h2><time>Jul 23, 2024</time>
