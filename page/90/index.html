Netflix’s new limited series Maniac defies the notion of world-building, rooted as it is in a series of trippy, hallucinated fantasy settings created in the minds of protagonists Owen (Jonah Hill) and Annie (Emma Stone) under the influence of psychotropic drugs.
But before all of that, the 10-episode drama grounds its story in a version of New York that feels both familiar and disorienting, both dated and futuristic. Computer technology with the unique style of the 1980s exists alongside dystopian riffs on privacy fears and the gig economy: If you’re broke, you can sell yourself to an “Ad Buddy,” whereby your bills get paid in exchange for a person accompanying you everywhere and spouting advertisements, like a human pop-up you can’t close.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Tiara Comte?
