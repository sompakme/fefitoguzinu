Jacob and Esau both knew of their standings in their father's eyes, particularly Jacob who was out of luck regardless.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Bridgerton Star Golda Rosheuvel's Real-Life Partner, Shireen Mula?</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

I move on like a sinners prayer
And letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
Or built to fade like your favorite song
Get reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
But I'm better as a memory than as your manNever sure when the truth won't do</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alan Titchmarsh reveals stark health warning from his wife amid painful ailment</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>
