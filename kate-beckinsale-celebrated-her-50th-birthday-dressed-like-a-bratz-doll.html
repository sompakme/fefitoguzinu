She celebrated the milestone by eschewing the entire conversation about Barbie and going for a totally different doll-inspired celebration: think of her party as a BDSM bash with a dash of Bratz for good measure. In a series of photos posted to her Instagram Stories, the actress gave her followers a look into the festivities, which included a sweet-and-sexy matching set as well as a bubblegum pink harness and a rainbow plush penis. Yes, you read that right, and yes, you'll want to see the photos.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beckinsale's birthday suit brought together a pink-and-beige argyle cardigan with rhinestone bow closures and matching booty shorts. The playful outfit got a dose of sex appeal when she added a pink harness underneath and the ultimate Bratz-approved accessory: over-the-top buckled platform boots. Of course, Beckinsale looked stunning as she partied with her pals, including her mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point, she posed with a stuffed penis (because it was her party and she can do what she wants to). Other images included cakes, flowers, and plenty of love to go around.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/KateBeckinsale</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I tell you what. Getting old is [expletive] great. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the most magical day full of joy and love and dear dear friends and the odd bird (not me but also me)," she captioned her birthday Instagram post, which showed her with various animals and a balloon arch.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate spoke about aging recently, saying that she was allowing herself to embrace it and not try to escape the ravages of time via plastic surgery.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm frightened of paralyzing my face. My mom's voice is in my head, very loud, at all times. My mom wouldn't even get a facial, she is suspicious of anything like that and looks radiant and amazing," she told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a>&nbsp;back in 2021.
