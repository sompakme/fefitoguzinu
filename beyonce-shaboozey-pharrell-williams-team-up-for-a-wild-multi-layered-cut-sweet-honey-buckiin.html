The sequel to 2022's RENAISSANCE, the Beyhive and many others were excited for the project's sound when this was first revealed to us <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">during the Super Bowl</a>. This second installment in this act trilogy, the Houston native is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">paying homage to her country roots</a>. However, the icon said it best about what this LP is, "This ain't a country album. This is a Beyonce album." One of the perfect examples of that quote is "SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN'," which sees Beyonce work with Shaboozey and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pharrell</a> Williams.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is one of many songs that definitely is not <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pure country</a>, but has elements of the genre sprinkled in. Firstly, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Shaboozey </a>deserves a huge shout-out. He has been rising quickly over the last several months with his spin on the genre, adding elements of hip-hop. Now, because of that mixed audience, he earned the chance to work with not only Beyonce, but with Pharrell Williams too.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-sweet-honey-buckiin-by-beyonce-shaboozey-amp-pharrell-williams>Listen To "SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN'" By Beyonce, Shaboozey, & Pharrell Williams</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This multi-layered track might sound all over the place on the surface. However, each phase fits together fairly well. "SWEET" is dominated by Shaboozey with Beyonce coming in after over a jersey club/country beat. Then, "HONEY" is the shortest part and sees it go in a more R&B direction with a slower pace to the production and a more sensual singing performance. Finally, "BUCKIIN'" is the rowdiest part with hard-hitting thumping bass, the classic air horn sound effects, with a hint of guitar. Again, there is a lot to take in, but this trio delivers one of strongest bangers on the album for sure.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new song, "SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN'," by Beyonce, Shaboozey, and Pharrell Williams?
