Discussions about towels are rarely coveted, in sport or normal everyday life, but Michael Graham believes it’s great that tennis is placing them so high on its agenda.

English version:. . What’s up! . I haven’t been in touch for a while and I felt like telling you a little bit of what‘s been going on lately with my injury and my recovery. As you know, my injury was a hard blow, it was hard to take it in, and even today I’m having a hard time seeing myself out of the World Tour Finals, out of the tour, not being able to end one of the best seasons of my career due to another injury, this time with bad luck. . A few weeks went by and I find myself willing to go back to the court next year, to follow my doctor’s advice, to work with my team in order to have the best recovery possible. . Rehab is going well, I’m feeling better and that gives me confidence and desire to keep on playing. . Of course, I had to change my goals because of this. I felt like the world fell apart. I habe experience from past years with the wrist but I never expected something similar would happen again. . So be sure that I’m willing to keep on playing even if it’s not easy. It’s a fight against bad thoughts but without any doubt I will do whatever I can to be ready, to enjoy playing again and to leave this bad moments behind. I want to enjoy my time on court with all of you, I have a great time when you are there with me. Thank you for the love you send when I’m not where I am supposed to be. It makes me feel great. . Now we stay in touch again. Thank you for respecting my silence when I wasn’t feeling like saying anything. I will be telling you now how my recovery goes and in which tournament I will be making yet another comeback. I just wanted to send you this message, to say hi. Thanks for your support and a big hug. See you!</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=noopener>Team Delpo</a> (@teamdelpo) on Nov 7, 2018 at 9:30am PST</p><p>In between rehab, Del Potro posts pics about his sponsors.</p><p>Don’t forget to catch Djokovic on the Jonathan Ross Show this weekend.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Wow, what a line up!
