The moment of truth,” says Stone in a voiceover as a purple sports car drifts. The 45-second teaser gives glimpses at each of the film’s stars, many of whom are previous Lanthimos collaborators — <a href=# id=auto-tag_margaret-qualley data-tag=margaret-qualley>Margaret Qualley</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_joe-alwyn data-tag=joe-alwyn>Joe Alwyn</a>, Hong Chau, Mamoudou Athie and Hunter Schafer.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fans know that the excitement of anticipating the Greek director’s films comes from what they don’t know.

I try not to even think about it during the process because I’m afraid that it will make my choices more narrow.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kinds of Kindness comes on the heels of Stone’s Oscar win for her role of Bella Baxter in the filmmaker’s Poor Things. The film marks the pair’s fourth one together. They previously collaborated on 2018’s The Favourite, which garnered 10 Oscar noms, including best supporting actor for Stone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lanthimos directed the film from a script he co-wrote with Efthimis Filippou, whom he has also worked with multiple times on films like The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/emma-stone-kinds-of-kindness-yorgos-lanthimos-release-1235852607/>Kinds of Kindness</a> is slated to hit theaters June 21.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Kinds-of-Kindness-Publicity-EMBED-2024.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKy1zZ2qZqeWYriqusOnnKyrXam%2ForXLnqlmnZ2irm6%2F06ilnmWnnrmtscxmm5qen5p6urvRoKasZZyWu7W0yKamrGVhZ4B2hJVqaGxuXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./el-referente-de-moda-que-llev%C3%B3-las-tendencias-que-triunfar%C3%A1n-este-oto%C3%B1o-2020.html><span>←</span><span>el referente de moda que llev las tendencias que triunfarn este otoo 2020</span></a>
