For about seven years, she had her own small-scale touring company, but became dissatisfied by the failure of the venues to do justice to the ambition of the productions. “So I started renting bar spaces to perform in instead, and having a DJ play at the beginning to create more of an event,” she explains. It was around that time, in 2002, that she met Felix Barrett, who had founded Punchdrunk two years previously while studying at the University of Exeter and was a pioneer of ‘site-sympathetic’ performances – the concept we now know as immersive theatre. The pair’s vision aligned and Doyle came on board to help launch an early version of the much-lauded production Sleep No More, a darkly cinematic retelling of Shakespeare’s Macbeth that was subsequently taken to both New York and Shanghai.<br></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Michaela Coel on how to tell a story" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/mota-thumbnail-michaela-1605025200.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Doyle has seen the organisation expand from a scrappy start-up into an international success story. “I remember writing the very first application for an Arts Council grant,” she says. “Since then, our ambition has grown along with the scale of the buildings, the size of the cast and the quality of the performances. The biggest change in the past couple of years is that we’re now a commercial company rather than charity, so that means we’ve had to build partnerships and find investors to help us continue to grow.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, Doyle shares advice on what female leaders in any sector can learn from her experience of directing a company of performers…</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">1/ Recruiting the right people is the most important task facing any leader</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We might have 1,000 applications for a single role, which we’ll get down to about 30 candidates. Then we’ll spend three days in a dance studio watching them move, before bringing them into the building to see how they respond to the environment. We’re always looking for people who have something about them that’s magical, mysterious, beautiful or strange, who are charismatic enough to make the audience want to follow them.”</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">2/ Working as a team gets the best performances out of everyone</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We spend a lot of time at the beginning of the process working as an ensemble. Dance, by its nature, necessitates generosity and trust, so we’ll practise listening to each other in a very instinctive way. A big feature of Punchdrunk’s work is that it’s really collaborative, so we work together in the studio as much as possible, storyboarding and creating choreography together.”</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">3/ Good ideas can come from anywhere</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m always interested in hearing the best ideas in the room, and those don’t necessarily come from the artistic director or me. Part of my role is about ensuring that we listen to everyone’s suggestions, but also understanding when is the time to be able to close conversations down – in a nurturing, supportive way – and make clear decisions about the direction the work should go.”</p><img alt=punchdrunk title=Punchdrunk width=5836 height=3891 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/punchdrunk-s-the-burnt-city-photo-julian-abrams-performer-emily-mytton-1670517714.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Punchdrunk</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">4/ Everyone has a part to play</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I always tell the dancers to think about their character as the lead part in their own particular film.

It was only later that we became well-enough known to attract investment.”</p><img alt=punchdrunk title=Punchdrunk width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/punchdrunk-s-the-burnt-city-photo-julian-abrams-performer-chihiro-kawasaki-1-1670517750.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Punchdrunk</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">7/ Look for like-minded partners</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Identifying new collaborators in a relatively short space of time is often a challenge. We need producing partners who understand our vision and the huge mountain that needs to be climbed to realise work of this scale. As a leader, my job is to communicate our values and ideas to everyone we work with.”</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">8/ Stay positive.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When we had to pull the shutters down during the pandemic, we were so worried that consumer appetite would be too injured to recover.
