This was suggested because the outline of True’s head looked as though it has been taken from another image and photoshopped onto Stormi’s body.</p><p>Khloe later confirmed fan theories when she uploaded photos of True’s ‘first time’ at Disneyland in April.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kim-kardashian-admits-she-edited-true-into-a-snap-of-stormi>Kim Kardashian admits she edited True into a snap of Stormi</h2><p>Kim was left with no choice but to clear up the rumors as she admitted to the photoshop fail. In doing so she finally posted the original photos, which reveal Stormi and Chicago on a day out at the popular theme park.</p><p>The Skims founder captioned the pictures: “The original pics were Stormi!’ she confirmed in her Instagram stories. However, I asked @kyliejenner if I could post them and she said she wasn’t really feeling posting at the moment and so I respect that!” she confessed on Instagram</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS SEASON 2 ON HULU/DISNEY PLUS EVERY THURSDAY<br><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kim-kardashian-laughs-over-photoshop-fail>Kim Kardashian laughs over photoshop fail</h2><p>In the latest episode of The Kardashians, Kim, Khloé, and Kourtney met up for lunch at the Italian restaurant Il Fornaio, to discuss the photoshop scandal.</p><p>Khloé gave the game away when she told fans that it was her daughter’s first time at Disney, way after True’s supposed trip with Chi. The Good American co-founder told her sister, “Oh, my God, I’m so sorry, I forgot we made up that story,” she said, apologizing.</p><p>Explaining the reason behind the photoshop further, Kim explained on the Hulu show: “Basically, I have a grid for IG and I’m doing pinks and blues,” she told her sister. “There was the cutest picture of Chi and Stormi at Disneyland and they’re wearing pink.”</p><p>Kim explained, “I sent it to Kylie for approval, and she goes, ‘No, I really don’t want any pics of Stormi out right now’. I respect it so I Photoshop True’s face onto Stormi’s body.” Kim laughs.</p><p>Khloe admitted that she was fooled by the edit: She sent it to me and I said, “Wait, you took True to Disneyland without me? She said, “No, but I’m happy you thought that.”</p><p>Kourtney was also tricked: “No, I’ve seen this and I was thinking there’s no way anyone would ever do that.”</p><p>Talking directly to the camera, Kim added: ‘You heard it here first. It’s not a major scandal, I just wanted my grid pink and blue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-03-085946-1024x571.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kim-kardashian-denies-editing-belly-button>Kim Kardashian denies editing belly button</h2><p>One of the craziest photoshop rumors was when fans claimed Kim edited her belly button out of her image.</p><p>This time around, Kim denied the rumors: “Come on guys….
