Overall, she burst onto the scene with her Charli XCX-assisted track "Fancy." However, from there, it became a bit of a struggle for her to find traction. Although she had a massive fanbase, her mainstream output seemingly dwindled. Whatever the case, Azalea still has people who adore her, and they always check for her music when she releases. Unfortunately for them, it seems like she is taking a break from music for a while.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The artist revealed that she would be retiring</a>, and as you can imagine, some are disappointed. Iggy had started an OnlyFans with the goal of sharing exclusive snippets and songs. Moreover, she was on there to deliver some thirst traps to the masses. This is something she does quite frequently on Instagram. Sometimes, she will bless her fans with some bikini or lingerie shots, and that is exactly what she did on Wednesday. Below, you can even see that she flexed her tattoo sleeve.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-iggy-azalea-with-a-post>Iggy Azalea With A Post</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The lingerie in question was a black sparkly bra with a silver strap to it. Of course, the comments section was filled with fans who loved the photos. She could be seen surrounded by Murakami pillows, and it made for an aesthetic post. Interestingly enough the pictures came <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">just a day after her ex Playboi Carti came through with a new song</a>. If you are somebody who enjoys conspiracy theories, this is definitely one to dive into.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of Iggy Azalea and her marketing tactics, in the comments section down below.
