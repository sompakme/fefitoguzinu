Last year, Smith sat down with TIDAL's&nbsp;Rap Radar Podcast and talked about how he worked on the scene with his castmates, revealing that he had to dig deep in order to make the exchange believable. It was the late James Avery, also known as Uncle Phil, who helped him work through his frustrations and deliver the scene we all see today.</p><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So we're doing that scene and I'm having a hard time," Smith explains. "'Cause we were<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> rehearsing and everything so</a>...and then it comes to the moment and we're in the scene together, right. So I'm doing it, I'm messing up the lines 'cause I want it so bad and I'm in front of the audience and I'm doing it and I'm furious and he holds on to me and he says, 'Hey, relax. Relax. It's already in there. You know what it is...Look at me. Use me. Don't act around me. Act with me.' So he's talking me through it and everything. I get it together. So I do the scene and then he hugs me at the end. While he's hugging me he whispers in my ear. He says, 'That's f*cking acting right there.'"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Smith mentions that while working with Avery he was a<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> young man constantly looking</a> for Avery's favor.&nbsp;The rapper-actor held Avery in such high regard and used that in the scene. "It makes me teary right now because it was like I was using...I was using him. I wanted him to want me. I wanted him to approve of me. So actually in that scene with him I was transferring that energy onto James Avery."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
