The rap world was caught by surprise earlier this week when the feds executed a raid of two of Diddy's properties in Miami and Los Angeles. Ever since then, he's been completely under a microscope as paparazzi keep a close eye on both of his properties. In the aftermath of the raids, he's made moves like selling off all of his shares of Revolt TV, the network he co-founded in 2013. He reportedly had no advance knowledge of the raids and was in Miami with his family while they were taking place.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unsurprisingly, the massive story has given many people a chance to get their two cents in. Celebrities from across music and entertainment have weighed in with their thoughts. Some claim that it's overdue justice following months of damning allegations against Diddy. Others are claiming he's been a target of massive police overreach. Some, like Antonio Brown, haven't done much other than try and get a joke in at Diddy's expense. "Diddy remembering what prison is known for" AB made in a tweet earlier today, his first comments on the situation. Check out the post he made and some fan reactions to it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-antonio-brown-breaks-his-silence-on-diddy-situation>Antonio Brown Breaks His Silence On Diddy Situation</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sources also confirmed that electronics has been taken from the houses during the raids. What do you think of AB's joke about the Diddy situation? Do you think he should weigh in with something more than just a joke on the matter?
