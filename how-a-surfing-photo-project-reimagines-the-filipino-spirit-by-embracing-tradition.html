Debuting last year on June 12, Philippines Independence Day, Geotina released a second installment of the series on the same day this year to celebrate its anniversary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Living in Siargao and Mindanao shows me the importance of women in our culture," he tells BAZAAR.com. "I grew up surrounded by strong women and I always thought that they had a special place in the growth of the world and men. I figured it was time for me to create something around that concept."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Geotina, a street artist-turned-muralist who also surfs, first pitched the idea to his friends over coffee. At the time, the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had forced the world into lockdown, temporarily halting the income of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/ikit_agudo/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ikit class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ikit</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/apingagudo/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aping Agudo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Aping Agudo</a>—sisters and professional competitive surfers who work as surfing instructors in Siargao. They would come to star as the original muses of Pearls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Having surfed with them for years, Geotina says they inspired him to take up the project. "I've always loved their style and poise," he says.</p><img alt="black and white portrait of a woman dressed in traditional clothes surfing" title="black and white portrait of a woman dressed in traditional clothes surfing" width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc-3041-1656532913.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first step was to find the right <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tatlerasia.com/power-purpose/ideas-education/the-history-of-filipiniana data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Filipiniana dresses" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Filipiniana dresses</a>. The attire, influenced by the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, is characterized by its signature puffy butterfly sleeves, long skirts, and use of piña fabric, which are produced from the fibers of pineapple plant leaves. The modernization of the style made it difficult to track down traditionally made dresses, though they eventually sourced clothes from the brand <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/raffaella_mnl/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Raffaella's" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Raffaella's</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Geotina recalled the fitting with Ikit and Aping, in which doubts about the premise of the project began to creep up. "They were looking at me like I was crazy," he says. "Ikit was like, 'You really want us to surf in this?' Aside from expensive, those things are heavy. They're about a kilo and a half—plus add water to them."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He enlisted the help of surfing photographers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/brenstormin/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bren Fuentes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Bren Fuentes</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/surfclipsiargao/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jose Mirasol" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jose Mirasol</a> ("I'm not a surf photographer per se," says Geotina. "I have too much respect for that. It's another art form.") while Geotina acted as a creative director behind-the-scenes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The results are electric. Despite the (physical and metaphorical) weight of the clothes, Ikit and Aping cut effortlessly through the water, their fluid movements between a dramatic cloud-filled sky and lurching ocean frozen in time, both evoking and challenging colonial narratives of what it means to be Filipino.</p><img alt="woman smiles while surfing in traditional clothes" title="woman smiles while surfing in traditional clothes" width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc05901-1656532970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><img alt="woman surfing" title="woman surfing" width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc05927-1656533072.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's hard to do what they did," Geotina says of his friends. "It really is a testament to how good they are as surfers."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He dubbed the project Pearls, a name that conjured ideas of beauty and wisdom but that also doubled as a reference to the country's epithet as perlas ng silangan, a line from the national anthem that literally translates to "pearl of the East."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In black-and-white, there is a historical power to the photos, too, a sort of timelessness that leaves viewers unable to discern if they were shot days or decades ago. The dramatic contrast deifies and immortalizes the subjects, an effect that Geotina says was intentional.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm so obsessed with '60s and '70s surf films and photography," he says, citing images by Jeff Divine of icons like Gerry Lopez and Rory Russell. "I wanted Filipinos to have that."</p><img alt="woman surfing" title="woman surfing" width=2048 height=1366 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc06189-edit-1656533030.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the second installment of Pearls that dropped earlier this month, Geotina expanded the project to include <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/party_sleep/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Maricel Parajes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Maricel Parajes</a>, another Siargao local, and queer surfers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/colleenhammersmith/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Colleen Hammersmith" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Colleen Hammersmith</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/sandycoldura/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sandy Coldura" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sandy Coldura</a>.

"It bears some weight into these societal problems that we have now. I wanted to empower Asian culture because we lose so much from colonization, from Westernization. It's so rare to be able to use even our aesthetics as something that can reach the world."</p><img alt="woman surfing" title="woman surfing" width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc08482-1656533152.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><img alt="woman surfing" title="woman surfing" width=2048 height=1317 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc06446-1656533222.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p><img alt="woman surfing" title="woman surfing" width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc06106-1656533137.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Archie Geotina</span></p>Pearls is currently on view at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.qubegallery.ph/exhibitions/68-pearls-by-archie-geotina/overview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Qube Gallery" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Qube Gallery</a> in Cebu City until July 31.
