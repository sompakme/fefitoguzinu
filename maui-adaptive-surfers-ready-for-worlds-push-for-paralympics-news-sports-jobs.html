ONE MORE PHOTOGRAPHY photo</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s pretty much like putting both of your hands in a fist right in front of your field of vision and I can see in that periphery what’s around it,”</span> Paulk said. “It’s a progressive eye disorder, so you know I could wake up, you can always wake up tomorrow and a certain level can be gone.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s been stable for the past eight years, but I notice small changes, nothing drastic.”</span></p><p>His next competition will be perhaps the most important of his career to date.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’ll be exciting to see all who show up — the sport is growing, we’re all really excited,”</span> Paulk said. <span class=quotations>“It’s a smaller, but mighty (Hawaii) team this year.”</span></p><p>The Hawaii Adaptive Surf Team will be represented by Paulk and fellow Mauians Josh Bogle (kneel division), Scott Davis (prone 2) and Shawn Lewis (stand 2); Oahu’s Ann Yoshida (prone 2) and Harrison Doi (stand 1), Kauai’s Eric Lazar (prone 2), and Hawaii Island’s Casey Proud (prone 1).</p><img width=600 height=750 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2022/11/04071857/fc-adaptive-surf-scott-davis.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Scott Davis is set to compete for Team Hawaii in prone 2 at next month’s world championships in California. Accessurf photo</p><p><span class=quotations>“We’re trying to raise funds for everything — for registration fees, for travel, for accommodations, basically for the entire team,”</span> Paulk said.</p><p>Currently on a surf trip in northern Nicaragua, Paulk, a self-employed consultant for local tour companies, said he is enjoying the sport he didn’t take up until the age of 30.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s pretty much all beach break, so the conditions are really nice, the waves are intimidating, but it’s really good to just practice on a beach break,”</span> Paulk said. <span class=quotations>“Really remote, uncrowded breaks, so it’s really fun.”</span></p><p>While he would be under the U.S. team if the sport is accepted into the Paralympics, he would relish the opportunity to represent his home state where he has lived since 2014.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Oh, it would be an honor to represent Hawaii and USA because once it becomes a Paralympic sport Team USA and Team Hawaii will merge together just like they do in the Olympics,”</span> Paulk said. “So to represent Hawaii and Team USA in the Paralympics would be kind of a dream come true.</p><p><span class=quotations>“That’s kind of the main goal in this whole surfing thing, making that team and just creating more knowledge around visually-impaired athletes and those who have disabilities in general, just creating more awareness and being an advocate. Just raising the bar, raising the platform to make that Paralympic team.”</span></p><p>In competitions, Paulk has a spotter who surfs out with him to help spot waves. When he is on surfing trips, the guide is usually his girlfriend.</p><p>That adds to the expense for these types of competitions, therefore a local fundraising effort is underway, according to Hawaii team coordinator Jennifer Gladwin.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We just launched our first website, it’s HawaiiAdaptiveSurfTeam.com,”</span> Gladwin said. <span class=quotations>“And we have two ways of financially supporting the team right now. One is by cash donation or donation through the website, there’s a donate button. Through the same platform you can also purchase team shirts. We have long sleeve, short sleeve and women’s.”</span></p><p>Gladwin said the support staff to help the adaptive surfers travel and compete make the expenses tough to meet. The fundraising goal is $16,000.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Traveling as a wheelchair user or a person with a disability can be double the expense and some of the surfers come in teams,”</span> Gladwin said. “So like Aaron has his spotter, his teammate. Two of our other surfers are prone-assisted surfers, they have a pusher. They have someone who pushes them into the wave and they surf the wave independently.</p><p><span class=quotations>“So we not only have to cover the athletes, we also have to cover their support team. And we’re looking at flights and then a little over a week, about 10 days of hotels and our uniforms as well.”</span></p><p>There will be adaptive divisions at the VISSLA/Hi-Tech Lopez Surfbash XXXIII, a Hawaii Surf Association event set for Hookipa Beach Park on Nov. 12-13.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We are also always looking for volunteers for water support and other roles,”</span> Gladwin said. <span class=quotations>“Interested people can email the team at hiadaptivesurfteam@gmail.com.”</span></p><p>* Robert Collias is at rcollias@mauinews.com.</p><a href=#><img width=240 height=300 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2022/11/04071857/fc-adaptive-surf-scott-davis-240x300.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-1041143 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Scott Davis is set to compete for Team Hawaii in prone 2 at next month’s world championships in California.
