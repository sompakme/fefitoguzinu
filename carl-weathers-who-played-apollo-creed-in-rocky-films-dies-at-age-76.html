Based on the braggadocios Muhammad Ali as he went into battle against likable no-hoper Chuck Wepner, Creed did battle with Rocky (played by Sylvester Stallone) in the first two films, before becoming a friend and training partner to Ali in the third and fourth films.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though Creed’s character dies in Rocky 4 at the hands of Ivan Drago, the character lives on through the three Creed movies, starring Michael B.

Standing 6’2” and weighing 220 pounds, Weathers played college football as a defensive end for Long Beach City College and San Diego State University, where he also earned a master in theatre arts. He went undrafted but signed with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1970, helping them win the AFC West division title. He later played in the Canadian Football League from 1971-73.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Among Weathers’ other movie credits are roles in the Adam Sandler films “Happy Gilmore” and “Little Nicky” as well as 1987’s Predator.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In an emotional Instagram video, Stallone paid tribute to his colleague.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“My life was forever changed for the better the day I met Carl Weathers.
