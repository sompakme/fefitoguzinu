Jeff has established himself as a leader and an innovator and we are confident that he will continue to build value for our advertising partners across all of our platforms.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gambelli, who has worked in advertising for more than 40 years, including senior roles at NBCUniversal and Horizon Media, joined Fox in 2017 to lead ad sales for Fox News, and was promoted to president of ad sales in 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It has been an honor to lead this talented team during such a transformative period in our industry,” added Gambelli. “I know they are well positioned under Jeff’s leadership to continue to set the standard for excellence for delivering results for our advertising partners.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Collins, meanwhile, joined Fox in 2019 from Viant, where he was chief revenue officer, and previously worked as a senior ad sales executive at Turner Broadcasting.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I look forward to leading the Ad Sales team as we continue to work with our valued partners to provide unique and compelling connections with the passionate audiences only Fox can offer,” Collins said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The changes in Fox’s ad business come ahead of the 2024 upfront season, with traditional linear television still reeling, and streaming video on the rise. Fox, however, has benefitted from its strong sports lineup, with live sporting events largely immune to the slowdown in ad spend in other genres of programming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmp52nYrOwxIyam2arkaGytHnCoaCenl2fsqeyjJympaSZo8BufZFsbHFoY2eAcXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./movies-starring-jaden-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Movies starring Jaden Smith</span></a>
