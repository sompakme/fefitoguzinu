The former flyweight likes to run his mouth probably more than he runs his fists. Bryce Mitchell currently fights in the featherweight division but at one point got into a verbal altercation with the Sugershow involving some of his comments.</p><p>Sean took on top contender Petr Yan for his last fight at UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi. It is a common practice for fighters to pick their favorites for upcoming bouts in the fighting world. Bryce Mitchell was also asked about what he thought about the UFC 280 matchups. ‘Thug Nasty’ said in reply that he thought both Islam Makhachev and Sean O’Malley were not worthy to take on their respective opponents.</p><p>Islam didn’t respond to such comments being the classy gentleman he is but Sean probably had some hidden insecurities. The situation got worse when the ‘Sugar’ picked up an extremely controversial victory against Petr ‘No Mercy’ Yan. Fans began piling on Montana-born and it seemingly affected him mentally.</p><p>In a reaction video, Sean listens to Bryce talk about his picks and then responds with “Your dad f***ed his sister to make you.”</p><p>Such offensive comments were not taken well by Mitchell who accused the controversial Bantamweight of calling him an Inbred.</p><h2>What is the latest development between Sean O’Malley and Bryce Mitchell?</h2><p>Talking in his podcast, O’Malley said, “I was just trying to be a good co-worker, but apparently he wants to fight me. I don’t know. I was just trying to be a nice person — that’s what gets you for being a nice person nowadays. People want to fight you for that s—t. I wonder if he literally thinks ‘fight’ is spelled that (fite). I think he might (laughs).”</p><p></p><p>He decided to make some further offensive comments saying,</p><p>“You see Bryce getting all upset with me? We had a little back-and-forth.”</p><p>“He started it, dude. He said I don’t deserve to fight Petr and I’m just using my mouth to get me fights. And I said, ‘Your dad f—ked his sister and made you.’ Kidding, obviously. Then apparently, maybe I wasn’t, because he got all offended. Usually, if you get offended that means they’re right,” he concluded.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sean is currently calling out Henry Cejudo</a> but no contract has been finalized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmsqelp3qlrcNmnZ1lmJ7Abr%2FIrKueql2Wu6V5zJqbnmWppMJuv8SapWannZa5rbHYZpmlmZ2awG6u0bKanmWdnsGktMSlo6xllJ7AscHTnmSopl2YvK%2By1KygqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-spencer-pratts-parents-spencer-pratt-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Who are Spencer Pratts Parents?
