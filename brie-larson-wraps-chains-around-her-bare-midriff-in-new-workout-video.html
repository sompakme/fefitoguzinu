She made news in 2019 for pulling a nearly 5,000 pound jeep as part of her <a href=#>workout</a> routine (via <a href=#>Bazaar</a>). This was not just for any workout routine. The actress committed to her health in preparation for portraying Carol Danvers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Carol – or as she is better known, Captain Marvel – is known as the strongest person in the Marvel universe. She is a relatively new addition to the ensemble but has made waves in Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame.</p><p>Brie Larson continues to prove that she is Captain Marvel and not only in name. Movie magic could certainly make Captain Marvel’s strength believable, but clearly Larson wanted to earn her place. In a recent video on her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Larson demonstrates her new workout regimen. This includes wrapping chains around her waist while doing pushups. This video is only the latest in impressive feats of strength she has done with the help of her trainer.</p><p>The actress has come a long way in her career. Many may have forgotten that not only was Brie Larson a captivating actress in independent films, but also had a short-lived <a href=#>music</a> career. Larson herself <a href=#>tweeted</a> out a reminder of her pop career. Fans can see a 2009 music video entitled “She Said.” Larson had been in the pop circuit for a moment before segueing into acting.</p><p>Brie Larson appeared in small parts of episodic television such as Touched By An Angel and Ghost Whisperer. It wasn’t long before she landed the role of Envy Adams in Edgar Wright’s Scott Pilgrim vs. the World which proved to be instrumental for her. Her star power continued to climb. Independent film Short Term 12 proved to be a catalyst for many up and coming stars. The film featured John Gallagher Jr., Lakeith Stanfield, and Kaitlyn Dever in the dramatic film about a residential treatment facility. Larson’s performance in Room granted her an Oscar in <a href=#>2016</a>. This was all before claiming the title of Captain Marvel.</p><p>The actress has had an impressive career thus far. If her workout regimen is any indication, Brie Larson will continue to make great strides in her upcoming projects.&nbsp;The Captain Marvel sequel, entitled<a href=#> The Marvels</a>, is currently in production and is slated to premiere in 2023. This is a long way to wait, but there are many specifics to look forward to. The Marvels will be directed by Nia DaCosta who impressed audiences with her recent Candyman film. Also set to appear is Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) who first appeared in her adult incarnation in WandaVision. Monica is expected to be reprising her character with powers she obtained in WandaVision. Also to appear is new character Kamala Kahn (Iman Vellani) who is taking up the mantle of Ms. Marvel.</p><p>Brie Larson is keeping in shape to keep up with the new additions to the cast. But she has more projects on the horizon as well. She is set to star in the television series Lessons In Chemistry. The series is a period drama about scientist Elizabeth Zott who finds herself pregnant and without a lab in the 1960’s. In the meantime, Larson continues to work <a href=#>on Marvel studio sets</a> and impress viewers with her feats of strength.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkqe2pnnLmqmsp55isKmtyKeqZq%2Bfp7iwwdNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-comprehensive-guide-to-blackout-curtains-benefits-and-customization.html><span>←</span><span>A Comprehensive Guide to Blackout Curtains: Benefits and Customization</span></a>
