Yet perhaps his most prominent remains the long-lost Spyro The Dragon, who originally captured our hearts upon his introduction in 1998. While he was dropping his Da Game Is To Be Sold Not To Be Told&nbsp;album, Snoop was no doubt sneaking in Spyro sessions on the sly, chasing down&nbsp;egg thieves,&nbsp;freeing crystallized dragons, and collecting various amulets and trinkets from the world's colorful denizens. Anybody who grew up in the era of Playstation 1 can attest to the glorious dragon-centric franchise. Now, it would appear a renaissance is upon us.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In case you missed it, news recently broke that the beloved Spyro trilogy would be making a welcome return to the latest batch of consoles. While that in and of itself is enough to trigger feelings of nostalgia fueled ecstasy, it seems to have had a particular impact on the LBC legend. Taking to Instagram, Snoop decided to throw up a Throwback snap of his Spyro The Dragon t-shirt. "I heard my nephew&nbsp;@Spyro&nbsp;was making a comeback so I had to unleash this," he writes, holding up the vintage tee.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With the colorful and vibrant art direction, there's no doubt Spyro would prove a stimulating journey for the perpetually stoned. I for one welcome a return of our new Draconic overlords. Catch the remaster on September 21st.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdpbYB6f4yspainoGKxsLPGZpqepJWXv6LAxKxkq52kqr%2Bvec6fZKGho2K7przHnq5mq6Cuv7B506GcZpyilrSwuoynnLCr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-jordan-makes-surprising-comments-about-steph-curry-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Jordan Makes Surprising Comments About Steph Curry: Watch</span></a>
