Yet another testament to its excellence: The product is the number one best-seller in Amazon’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">densely populated facial oil category</a>. And, for a limited time, Palmer’s highly lauded elixir is on sale for a mere $10.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Palmer’s Skin Therapy Face Oil</a> is a highly skin-softening and lightweight skin treatment. Formulated for all skin types, it features a cocktail of anti-aging vitamins plus retinol — the line-smoothing and skin-firming hero ingredient that’s considered, virtually indisputably, skincare’s preeminent anti-ager. Key benefits include fading dark spots, minimizing the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and improving uneven skin tone. Though it’s technically an oil, the formula features a velvety, lightweight feel and a fast-absorbing texture. A single use delivers an instant boost in glow, per shoppers; over time, skin appears firmer, smoother, and more even-toned.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each of the oil’s key ingredients — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin C</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vitamin E</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>retinol</a> — boast ample dermatologist acclaim. Moreover, vitamin C and E have been found to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>work remarkably well together</a> insofar as their age-defying properties, as they protect one another from degradation and, in turn, boost effectiveness. Vitamin C is a skin-brightening antioxidant that can even tone and has protective effects against <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>environmental skin-agers</a>, while vitamin E, another antioxidant, is also hailed for its supple-inducing properties.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper</a> called the face oil “magic,” noting that their skin looks glowier than ever since using it. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another reviewer</a> who deals with notable facial redness said the formula has reduced much of the issue.
