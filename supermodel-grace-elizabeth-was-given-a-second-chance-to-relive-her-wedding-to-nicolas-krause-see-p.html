Luckily when you’re a supermodel and the High Jewellery muse for an iconic diamond brand, there is a salve.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHc5c76bnyLp data-wc=58><strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Graff</a> </strong>invited Grace to shoot the House’s new Bridal campaign, and surprisingly invited her real-life husband to take part, in order for the couple to relive the moment again and document it. Shooting in Sri Lanka, it was their opportunity to enjoy all the precious moments they had missed, with the bride dressed in diamonds from the House’s collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQo6w8jouqxm data-wc=2><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>7 statement jewellery trends to ensure that all eyes are on you</a>,</strong></p><p id=e_4m-B1bjvCJ data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Bulgari is hosting a Serpenti exhibition at Saatchi Gallery this autumn</a></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92872e2fbc96-gebride2-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=evjhyCgfLqtv data-wc=8><strong>The real-life couple star in Graff's bridal campaign</strong></p><p id=ec_kvh7aX98P data-wc=94>"This was like our wedding…&nbsp; we will look back and celebrate this as the day,"&nbsp;Grace Elizabeth explains. The deep love, connection and happiness between the pair is palpable and brings a beautiful and unique authenticity to the jewellers latest campaign. "I think one really wonderful thing about Graff and their engagement rings and their promise settings and their icon settings is that each is so different and encompasses a different kind of bride,"&nbsp;Grace reflects. But what was her favourite piece to wear? "I really like square, just the simple classic square cut."</p><p id=egfKpOOd15ew data-wc=57>Graff's unique approach to selecting diamonds relies on expertise that has been passed down through generations, with each diamond assessed by a member of the family according to the Graff standard of beauty. Their workshop is one of the biggest in Europe on Albemarle Street in Mayfair, incorporating a highly technical design software with in-house trained craftsmen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6637c122713-gebride3-z.jpg><p id=eup7xUHgVmpu data-wc=7><strong>The campaign was shot in Sri Lanka</strong></p><p id=ercuCW5dnThq data-wc=83>The 'pièce de résistance' of the campaign is the brand's new Promise setting. Ever since its launch 60 years ago, the Promise setting has been among the most enduringly popular of Graff's engagement rings. To celebrate the release of this real-life love story, the house reimagined this timeless design to maximise the play of light through the diamonds. Working with their craftsmen they minimised the amount of metal surrounding the diamonds while creating a seamless flow between the shank, shoulders and centre stone.</p><p id=ezOVftKiCy2l data-wc=37>As for Grace, she gives some advice to other couples and 'Covid Brides' who have had a similar experience, "A wedding doesn't really matter. You're choosing to marry the love of your life, and that's what counts."</p><p id=e0_55qz871Il data-wc=7><strong>&nbsp;The new <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Promise setting</a> is now available in stores.</strong></p><p id=ev3NNoHsnOSn data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
