The story is horribly plausible. A smart, suburban 14-year-old, Liberato meets a boy in an internet chatroom. He says she's cute. She thinks he's 16. I didn't want to freak you out, he explains a while later, but I'm a college student. Insidiously, his age creeps up and up. When they finally meet, she is face to face with a man pushing 40, a clean-cut dad in slacks and practised manipulator.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>It sounds pretty harrowing.</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Yes, but Schwimmer focuses more on the emotional fallout in her family than the rape itself – Clive Owen and Catherine Keener play shell-shocked parents. Schwimmer has been involved with an American rape charity for more than a decade, and spent seven years developing the story.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Isn't Liberato a bit young for the material?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>She has been acting most of her life and is no stranger to adult themes – a few years ago she had a part in CSI Miami. American critics have been impressed by her maturity. Time magazine announced: "A 14-year-old star is born." Roger Ebert admired her "remarkable performance", praising the film as one of the year's best. Others have found it a&nbsp;bit issues-heavy.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>What next?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Something completely different: a&nbsp;couple of action movies: The Expatriate with Aaron Eckhart, and Joel Schumacher's kidnap thriller, Trespass, opposite Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJulocG2vsRoaWlpYWS3trqOa2ponpmnwLV50qKeoaxdobaiusBmo6Kalaeutbs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./disney-dreamlight-valley-what-is-raccoons-how-to-feed-raccoons.html><span>←</span><span>Disney Dreamlight Valley: What is Raccoons? | How to Feed Raccoons?</span></a>
