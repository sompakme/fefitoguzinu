Moreover, reports recently indicated that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he hired sheriff deputies for heightened security at the shoot</a>, which some corners of social media thought was hypocritical, cowardly, unnecessary if his connects are as deep as he says, and other conspiratorially negative descriptors. However, many online were quick to retort with the loss of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nipsey Hussle</a> years ago and plenty of other examples of violent escalations and situations when it comes to rappers out in public. All in all, the common Internet sentiment reflects an understanding that this is nothing special or condemnable, and that haters are missing the point.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, if that's not an angle about this supposed Kendrick Lamar music video that you subscribe to, there are many others to consider. For example, new footage recently emerged of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bobbi Althoff in Compton</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YG</a> and others, which many took to mean that she's either on set for this visual or will straight-up appear in it. Of course, if this ends up being for "Not Like Us," it would seem like a very ironic cameo that could easily blow back in folks' face. We'll have to understand more of the context behind this to see what it all means.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kendrick-lamar-catches-flack-for-more-security-see-replies-to-tweet-below-for-more-fan-debates>Kendrick Lamar Catches Flack For More Security: See Replies To Tweet Below For More Fan Debates</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking of security, though, Drake recently sent <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a celebratory message</a> to his main bodyguard, OVO's Chubbs, via his Instagram Story. While it didn't outright reference the Kendrick Lamar beef or any associated topics, it is one of his first public statements after "The Pop Out." As such, many folks took Drizzy's acknowledgement of "that s**t coming back around" as a subliminal allusion to the feud. Whether or not that's true is for the tinfoil hat crew to determine, because either way, it's not the response many anticipate.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, considering that Kendrick Lamar's Juneteenth concert included <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a tribute to Nipsey Hussle</a>, it's no surprise that he would be so cognizant of staying safe and up-keeping proper and necessary security protocol. This is much bigger than macho tendencies of rap beef. Hopefully everything turns out great for the visual or whatever Compton's getting up to this weekend. After all, this social media debate can't be all for nothing.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoV1f5Zmop6mlKe2pLeMpZimmaJiura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxuv8ScrKuhpK56o63CpKOaq5hitaq8jKGmqWWemsS0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joanna-lumley-s-lavish-home-with-husband-of-36-years-inside.html><span>←</span><span>Joanna Lumley's lavish home with husband of 36 years inside</span></a>
