He has made millions after thrusting himself into the spotlight and becoming a political figure, but just how much is the Barack Obama net worth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=barack-obamas-net-worth>Barack Obama’s Net Worth</h2><p>Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, have a combined net worth of $70 million. However, Obama didn’t start out wealthy. In fact, he started like many other people in America did.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=early-life-barack-obama>Early Life Barack Obama</h2><p>President Obama, born Barack Hussein Obama II, was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to his parents, Ann and Barack Obama Sr. His parents wed, and baby Barack was born six months later. However, their marriage did not last.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1964, the couple divorced. Barack Obama Sr. moved back to Kenya, where he was originally from. Then, he married his third wife. He visited Barack a handful of times in Hawaii but died in a car accident in 1982 when Barack Obama was 21.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1965, his mother married a man from Indonesia, Lolo Soetoro. However, his visa was rejected, forcing him to move back to Indonesia. Barack and his mother moved to Indonesia in 1967 to be with him. At the time, Barack was only six years old. He remained in Indonesia until 1979, when he moved back to Honolulu to stay with his grandparents on his mother’s side. That is where he attended high school. Unfortunately, his mother passed away due to cancer in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>After high school, President Obama moved to Los Angeles, where he received a scholarship at Occidental College.

She was assigned to be Barack Obama’s advisor when he was working at a law firm. However, the couple began to fall in love. They were engaged in 1991 and married in 1992.&nbsp;</p><p>For many years, Michelle was considered the breadwinner of the family as she brought home much more than Obama did as an attorney. However, that would change when Barack continued to rise through the political ranks.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Barack-Obama-President.webp><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=politics>Politics</h2><p>Outside of his main jobs, Barack Obama continued to strive for political success.

This number only increased after he became president of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>His earnings did not all come from their salaries, though.
