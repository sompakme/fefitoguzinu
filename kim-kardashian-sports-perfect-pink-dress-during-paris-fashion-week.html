Kylie, Kendall, and Kris Jenner have all shown up at various runway shows all week. For Kendall in particular, it's been mixed results. She's appeared on some pretty major runways as a model <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">including the Versace and Schiaparelli shows.</a> But many fans online have been pretty critical of her actual performance as a model. She's been called out multiple times at different shows for not having her runway walk mastered.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kim Kardashian</a> is also in town and made a much more low-stakes appearance at Victoria Beckham's fashion show. According to Page Six, she turned up with her mother Kris Jenner in perfectly contrasting outfits. Kim's bubblegum pink dress absolutely stole the show but Kris' black-on-black leather jacket look was another major highlight. Unsurprisingly they were among the guests of honor at the show. They took a spot next to Anna Wintour and Victoria's husband David Beckham alongside the pair's three kids.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kim-kardashian-s-pink-dress-at-victoria-beckham-s-show>Kim Kardashian's Pink Dress At Victoria Beckham's Show</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 12: Kim Kardashian attends Kering's 2nd Annual Caring For Women Dinner - Arrivals at The Pool on September 12, 2023 in New York.

The pair are often spotted together and even more often make viral tiktoks on their shared KimandNorth account.

She's appearing in the celebrity themed new season of American Horror Story. Fans have pretty <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">universally praised her performance</a> in the show thus far and many are excited about where the season will go next.
