There’s got to be some fantastic way where I can shrink to an ant size and explode, whatever it is.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “I want to use all those effects. But, that was on the last one. Now, I don’t think I’m going to show up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Douglas spoke to THR on the<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/THR/status/1622837086306058240> red carpet for Quantumania </a>in 2023. When asked if he would return for a fourth film if there was one, he had one condition: “as long as I could die.” In a separate interview with ComicBook.com, Marvel executive Stephen Broussard noted that conversations about <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/ant-man-4-conversations-marvel-studios/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a fourth film</a> were already happening before it came out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When it hit theaters, the film did <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ant-man-and-wasp-quantumania-marvel-1235330062/>better at the box office</a> than the first two films in the franchise did. But it continued the trend of Marvel Cinematic Universe projects receiving a lower CinemaScore on opening weekend, following straight A’s for 21 films.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When speaking to THR at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/paul-rudd-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-jonathan-majors-kang-1235319857/><a href=# id=auto-tag_ant-man-wasp data-tag=ant-man-wasp>Ant-Man and the Wasp</a>: Quantumania premiere</a>, Douglas also shared that he took comfort in reuniting with a lot of the castmembers from the first two films, like Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kathryn-newton-1235324531/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathryn Newton</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Having the comfort factor of knowing each other, you don’t have to go through the formal introductions,” he said at the time. “You all know each other. It makes it very comfortable, and Peyton Reed being the same director. It was a nice experience.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the third installment of the Ant-Man franchise, Rudd’s Scott Lang must defeat Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conquerer, the most powerful villain in the MCU thus far who was introduced in Loki season one.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Quantumania was originally set to kick off the next phase of the MCU, leading up to the release of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. However, following <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/jonathan-majors-trial-verdict-1235759607/>Majors being found&nbsp;guilty</a>&nbsp;in December of reckless assault in the third degree and guilty of harassment, Marvel dropped the actor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The studio has <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-drops-jonathan-majors-as-kang-1235391129/ rel="noreferrer noopener">two courses it could take </a>after dropping Majors. It could recast the part of Kang or redevelop its plans for the next phase and work to find a new villain to center on. According to sources, there are indications that Marvel is taking the latter approach, as Loki creator Michael Waldron was hired in November to work on a new draft of a script for what is now being referred to as Avengers 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK61wqGYnqRdmby2s8uaqmaZnql6rq3NZpqhmaKWsLWx0WaioqScmrFuu8WfZKqtkaPBtrnAp6CaZWFngHaElm5pamtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-jenner-s-adorable-timothee-chalamet-phone-background-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner's Adorable Timothee Chalamet Phone Background Revealed</span></a>
