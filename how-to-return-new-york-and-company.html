data-sourcepos=5:1-5:8><strong>Here's the lowdown on getting your return on (without the tears):</strong></p><h3 data-sourcepos=7:1-7:43>Round One: The Online Return Throwdown</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:39><span>Bought something online that just isn't your jam?</span><span> No sweat!</span><span> New York & Company offers </span><strong>free returns</strong><span> (hallelujah for small victories).</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=11:1-12:222><li data-sourcepos=11:1-11:148><strong>Gear Up:</strong><span> First things first,</span><span> you'll need your order number and email address.</span><span> This dynamic duo can be found on your order confirmation email.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=12:1-12:222><strong>Enter the Returnal Arena:</strong><span> Head over to New York & Company's return portal (</span><a class=traceable-link rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>https://www.nyandcompany.com/pages/return-policy</a><span>).</span><span> This is where you'll choose which items you're returning and why they didn't work out (don't worry,</span><span> they won't judge your indecisiveness).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=13:1-13:212><strong>Get Label-Ready:</strong><span> Once you've selected your return items,</span><span> you'll be able to print a </span><strong>prepaid shipping label</strong><span>.</span><span> Think of it as your golden ticket back to New York & Company's clutches (or lack thereof).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=14:1-14:266><strong>Pack Like a Pro:</strong><span> Now for the not-so-thrilling part:</span><span> packing.</span><span> Grab the item(s) you're returning,</span><span> shove them back in the original packaging if you can (because everyone loves a good re-use),</span><span> and include that packing slip you generated during the return process.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=15:1-16:0><strong>Ship It Out!:</strong><span> Slap that prepaid label on your package,</span><span> making sure it's the star of the show (no competing labels allowed!</span><span>),</span><span> and drop it off at your favorite shipping spot.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:176><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> You have </span><strong>7 days</strong><span> from creating your online return request to actually ship it out.</span><span> Don't let that package become a resident of your living room floor (we all know how easily that happens).</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:84>Round Two: The In-Store Showdown (Because Sometimes You Need Human Interaction)</h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:121><span>Maybe you're more of a face-to-face kind of person.</span><span> No problem!</span><span> New York & Company accepts returns in-store as well.</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=23:1-26:0><li data-sourcepos=23:1-23:196><strong>Assemble Your Crew:</strong><span> Grab the item(s) you're returning,</span><span> the original invoice or packing slip (proof you didn't just steal that cute sweater),</span><span> and head to your nearest New York & Company.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=24:1-24:156><strong>Channel Your Inner Warrior:</strong><span> Be prepared to politely explain to the cashier why you're returning your purchase.</span><span> They've seen it all,</span><span> so don't be shy.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=25:1-26:0><strong>Choose Your Destiny:</strong><span> Here's where things get exciting:</span><span> you get to decide if you want a </span><strong>refund</strong><span> (because adulting requires real money) or </span><strong>store credit</strong><span> (hello,</span><span> future shopping spree!</span><span>).</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:119><strong>Remember:</strong><span> You have </span><strong>60 days</strong><span> from the purchase date to return items in-store.</span><span> That's plenty of time to decide if that floral blouse truly belongs in your wardrobe.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=29:1-29:34>FAQ: Returning Like a Champion</h3><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:57><strong>How to find my nearest New York & Company store?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=33:1-33:222><span>Use their store locator on their website (</span><a

data-sourcepos=35:1-35:44><strong>How long will it take to get my refund?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=37:1-37:150><span>Once New York & Company receives your return,</span><span> it can take </span><strong>5-7 business days</strong><span> for your refund to be processed.</span><span> Patience is a virtue,</span><span> my friend.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=39:1-39:40><strong>Can I return items I bought on sale?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=41:1-41:87><span>Yes,</span><span> you can!</span><span> However,</span><span> some exclusions may apply (check the fine print,</span><span> just

data-sourcepos=49:1-49:173><span>Exchanges are treated just like online returns.</span><span> Head to the return portal,</span><span> select "exchange" instead of "refund,</span><span>" and choose the
