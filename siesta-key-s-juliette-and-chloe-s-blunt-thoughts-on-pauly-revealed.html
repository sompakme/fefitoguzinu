When asked about Alex Kompothecras' cousin, <a href=#>Juliette Porter</a> told Nicki Swift, "We don't care about Paul. Yeah." Fellow cast member Chloe Trautman revealed, "I think Paul is a liability and anyone that associates with him is not placing themselves in a very smart situation." Chloe is likely referring to <a href=#>Pauly's recent controversial behavior</a>, which has allegedly included appearing on Instagram Live while taking drugs and conducting potentially inappropriate conversations on social media.</p><p>As for the way that Pauly treated his "Siesta Key" co-stars, Juliette explained, "He's said rude things to everyone. I mean, he posted on his Instagram that I had said that I wished horrible things upon Alex's unborn child. He just makes things up in thin air." Finally, Chloe said of Pauly, "He's a lost soul and pray for him, but no one needs to be around him." Basically, it doesn't sound as though the rapper will be appearing on "Siesta Key" again anytime soon.</p><p>Catch all the drama of <a href=#>"Siesta Key" Season 4 on MTV</a> on Wednesdays at 8/7c.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlkZYZye9KinKyskWK4psXSZqGupJmawbWxjJqlnWWTnbmwsdJmmaWtnql6tbTOrp6hrKNivK95z5qspbFdp7K3scClnJ1lla2wrcHSoq2eZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robin-roberts-enjoys-dreamy-honeymoon-in-cura%C3%A7ao-as-she-gears-up-for-gma-return.html><span>←</span><span>Robin Roberts enjoys dreamy honeymoon in Curaao as she gears up for GMA return</span></a>
