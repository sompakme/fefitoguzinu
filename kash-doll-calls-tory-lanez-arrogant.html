Moreover, Kash's comments come months after the court <a href=# rel>found him guilty</a> of shooting <a href=# class=text-word rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> back in 2020. While the discourse surrounding the case still lights up reply sections on Twitter, she's hinting at something else. Furthermore, she shared that Lanez should face scrutiny if his attack on Megan is part of a larger pattern.</p><p>The conversation started with Vlad acknowledging that Lanez has a history of "pulling guns out on people," citing a specific instance with rapper Dax. "It's just sad," the Detroit rapper began. "It's just sad. I'm just glad that Megan is probably in a better space. Because I feel like she was <a href=# rel>really depressed over that</a>." Then, Vlad said that the debacle turned into a "battle of the sexes." While women sided with Megan according to Vlad, men sided with Tory. Also, he mentioned that Tory probably though that he could beat the case, but things ultimately didn't pan out.</p><span><h2 id=h-kash-doll-weighs-in-on-tory-lanez-s-woes>Kash Doll Weighs In On Tory Lanez's Woes</h2></span><p>"That's just a sign of [arrogance]," Doll said of that presumed attitude. After that comment, the media personality added that he probably felt scared of going to jail, since he'd never gone. Not only that, but he suggested that his physical size played a role in that, which is more of a take you'd see on Twitter. "Probably all that stuff probably just <a href=# rel>caught up on him</a>," she responded. "You know... man, if you say he been doing that for years, and he been doing that to a lot of people, you have a history of that. Eventually he needed to sit down."</p><p>Meanwhile, authorities recently lifted a gag order on Lanez, so <a href=# rel>he can now speak on Megan and the criminal case</a>. While it hasn't panned out to much yet, his remarks on the topic should be quite interesting. After all, it's still a pretty present debate in people's minds, especially as both parties' careers unfold beyond it. Regardless of your take, stick around on HNHH for the latest on Kash Doll and Tory Lanez.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaX10fZFmopqrmGKxsLjLZpqapJyoerW70bJkpZmemsdurdGrpqCZnqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juicy-facts-about-the-reality-show.html><span>←</span><span>Juicy Facts About The Reality Show</span></a>
