Her answer is pretty funny, claiming that she hates when fans tell her she looks like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a>. "Cuz no the f*ck we do not look alike." The clip of the interaction that went viral provides a handy comparison between the two, showing that to some extent they kind of do look alike. Fans in the comments agreed.</p><p>"She literally do look like thugger tho," reads the top comment on the post and many others agree. "Man she ain’t fooling nobody I know thug when I see him," says one comment. "I never seen young thug n sexy redd in the same room before," reads another. The last one is particularly clever given that Young Thug has been incarcerated since Red first began to emerge as a budding rap superstar.
