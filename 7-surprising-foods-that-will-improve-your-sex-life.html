"You must make time for it and do things like having date night, making your bedroom a place you want to be romantic in, and paying attention to what you eat."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That includes having a generally healthy diet, Isadora says, but you can also grab specific <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://wellandgood.com/2015/06/04/11-surprising-delicious-foods-that-boost-brain-power/?utm_source=Partner&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=harpersbazaar" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=foods class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">foods</a> that do things like boost testosterone or blood flow when you're really trying to get in the mood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What's for dinner? &nbsp;Here, seven unexpected yet healthy foods Isadora recommends putting on your plate to get you (and your partner) excited.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Onions</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Okay, while onion breath may not be sexy, Isadora says the veggie strengthens reproductive organs and increases testosterone, which boosts libido in both men and women. "In Ayurveda, it's known as a tonic for building sexual energy," she says. "Monks have to avoid it because it's known to build up semen." (Bet you never thought you'd read that sentence.) But basically, you and your partner should chop it up and put it in everything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Garlic</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Garlic isn't just for warding off vampires. In fact, you might want to try feeding some to Robert Pattinson. "Garlic contains allicin, which builds heat in the body and has been proven to increase testosterone," Isadora explains. "It's useful for sexual stamina, and body builders use it for muscle growth." Feel like a little Italian tonight?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Cayenne Pepper</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just like cayenne's spicy on your tongue, it helps add spice to your sex life. "Hot peppers contain capsaicin, which creates heat and improves circulation and blood flow for erections," Isadora says. The peppers have an immediate effect, so try eating them when you're already ready to go. And maybe save dessert for later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Dates</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Isadora, dates are rich in amino acids , which are known to increase sexual stamina, and they're a popular aphrodisiac in North African countries like Nigeria. That's not all. "The act of eating dates can be very sexual," Isadora says. "They melt in your mouth. It's the kind of thing you could feed to your lover in bed." Ahem, we recommend setting aside some paper towels. They're sticky.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Figs</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like dates, figs are rich in amino acids, and are also said to be an aphrodisiac because of the sexual appearance and flavor. "A fig's scent and texture is very aromatic and sensual," Isadora says. "They are a luscious fruit to eat yourself or feed to your lover. It even looks sexual eating them." In other words, order them on a hot date, but do avoid the fig plate at your office holiday party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Goji Berries</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Isadora, goji berries have long been used as a sexual tonic in Asian countries because they're said to increase testosterone. "Try sprinkling these on your cereal, salads, or just eating a handful," she advises. Buying them in dried form is okay, too. "They're a sexual tonic and a superfood—a sexual superfood." Now that's a good marketing hook if I've ever heard one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Fatty Fish</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Salmon, tuna, and mackerel are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which Isadora says elevate dopamine, the same hormone released in the brain during an orgasm. "It also elevates mood, and more relaxed people are in the mood for sex more often," she adds. "Fatty fish also contains L-arginine, an amino acid used to treat problems with erections. Think of it like a natural Viagra." A nice grilled salmon definitely sounds better than a pill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAamhubGFkhG6%2F1Kunq6GjnruoecWopp2rXam1osCMsKClpF2eurG%2Bzq%2BcZrGfqr9uv8SxZKWhlpp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-best-ways-of-how-to-slide-into-dms-of-your-crush-like-a-pro.html><span>←</span><span>20 best ways of how to slide into DMs of your crush like a pro</span></a>
