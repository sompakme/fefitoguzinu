As you can see in the video, he was already wearing a medical boot before the fall. The young rapper is only sixteen years old and might just have a long and fruitful career ahead of himself. He recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">XXL</a> about his rising popularity saying, “"I don't even realize how big I am. I went to the mall just by myself. [I] told my dad, just stay out there, I'm finna go get something really fast. I'm walking, taking hella pictures. They like man why you in the mall like that?
