According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Roberts was arrested</a> after someone reported a fight in their hotel room and police found Peters with a bloody nose. Yet, Peters decided not to press charges and she was quickly released.</p><p dir=ltr>Not only did Peters not want his then-girlfriend in trouble, he was photographed just days later&nbsp;comforting her as she sobbed in his arms right after news of her arrest broke (per <a href=#>People</a>). An unnamed source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time that, "Their romance is pretty extreme. They just behave in a way that's very passionate." A rep for both Peters and Roberts seemingly tried to downplay the arrest, saying (via People), "It was an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding," adding, "the couple are working together to move past it."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While Roberts and Peters kept quiet about the whole thing, Roberts was quoted telling <a href=#>Nylon</a> before the incident, "I can't say I'm never going to mess up, but if I do, I'll definitely be very sorry." She also later addressed the difficulties of having a relationship be so public to <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> in 2019, saying,"It's hard enough to be with someone by yourself, let alone with an audience. Growing up is hard. Sometimes it makes me sad that I can't have a private moment."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xnaIN1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2aw6K6jKmcrZ2iqHqlrdOipaBlmJ7AtbvRsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-whose-relatives-are-really-poor.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Whose Relatives Are Really Poor</span></a>
