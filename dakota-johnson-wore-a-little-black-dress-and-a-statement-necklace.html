Black stockings peeked out from under the frock, and she styled the look with pointed-toe, ankle-strap Christian Louboutin heels. She accessorized with an equally as polarizing 2010s trend: a statement necklace constructed from black metal with a large gemstone in the middle. She also wore a stack of gold rings on one finger and dainty hoop earrings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johnson's hair was styled in long waves that cascaded down her back, complemented by her signature forehead fringe. In terms of glam, the star kept it simple with fringed lashes, rosy cheeks, and a mauve lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her interview with host Jimmy Fallon, Johnson actually cleared the air on one of her more viral quotes. Yes, the actress addressed her Wall Street Journal interview in which she said she needed 14 hours of sleep each night. "I’m not functional if I get less than 10," she told the publication at the time. "I can easily go 14 hours."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fallon went on to read some of the headlines that came from her interview to which Johnson replied, “I didn’t even say it like that. I don’t, like, demand it. I’m not a monster. I have a job."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Why is sleep bad? Like, why?" she quipped. "Leave me alone! I’m just asleep!”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that she also doesn't need help sleeping that long either before joking that if she took an Ambien, she'd "wake up next year." "I don't have to take anything to sleep like that either," she told Fallon. "I can just sleep like that."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w5qiqKyRYrewtM2spqdlpJ67unnVnqOvnaRiuaOwjKOgpqWpYrOiuMuopWZwZWmFdoCU</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-applegate-gives-fans-health-update-after-ms-diagnosis.html><span>←</span><span>Christina Applegate gives fans health update after MS diagnosis</span></a>
