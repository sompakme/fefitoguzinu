He was also Isaacs's favorite son, whereas Jacob was Rebekah's favorite. Each parent favored a child and each child was different. Esau was an outdoorsy huntsman, and Jacob was a shepherd (both depicted above) who often tended to the home (via <a href=#>Theology of Work</a>). Jacob and Esau both knew of their standings in their father's eyes, particularly Jacob who was out of luck regardless. Because this meant that in their father's passing, he'd have to follow the orders of his twin brother Esau. But Jacob's understanding of this fact is also what made him much more highly aware, much to the forthcoming detriment of Esau.</p><p dir=ltr>One day after a hunt, Esau was starving and hungry. Arriving home he saw a meal that Jacob prepared and desperately wanted to indulge. Knowing of his lifelong disadvantage for the birthright, Jacob thought of a scheming idea (via <a href=#>Bible Study Tools</a>). He said he would give Esau something to eat, but under the condition that he'd promise him his birthright. Crippled with hunger, Esau had to think quickly. Eat now and give up my birthright? Or refuse to give my birthright, and starve? In that moment, the birthright served no value to his hunger, and Esau thought of nothing to easily give it up. Which he did. However, the rash decision would come back to bite him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAl29oanFfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqGam5%2BXeqK6w2acrJmlqHqnsdSdZKKmXam1pnnBopmlnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-crews-continues-case-against-adam-venit-amid-sexual-assault-allegations.html><span>←</span><span>Terry Crews Continues Case Against Adam Venit Amid Sexual Assault Allegations</span></a>
