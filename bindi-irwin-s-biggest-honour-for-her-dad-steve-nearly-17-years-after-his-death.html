And, as she tells <strong data-copy-source=true data-gid=eMUcqrcwAV></strong>during a moving exclusive to mark World Earth Day, she hopes he's looking down upon her and would be proud of everything their family have achieved in honouring his legacy.</p><p id=emVfx0OqmLK data-wc=23>The devoted Wildlife Warrior, 24, fondly remembered her dad, 'The Crocodile Hunter', and championed continuing his mission to stand up for animals everywhere.</p><p id=eOh_pOg7Zi data-wc=96>"It's hard to believe it’s been over 16 years since he passed away," the conservationist told us. "In some ways, it still feels like yesterday that we were on our last crocodile research trip together as a family," she added. "I know in my heart that his love and enthusiasm will live on and that brings me great comfort." With the same fighting spirit as her dad, Bindi has big dreams to change the world with kindness. "We work hard to ensure Dad’s mission continues to grow, just like he wanted us to do," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e151ce3eaaec-bindi-cover.jpg><p id=eSzWsRKVfO data-wc=44><a class=hm-link href=#>Bindi's famous father was actually the inspiration</a> behind the name she chose for her daughter, her "graceful warrior". She explains: "The name Grace Warrior suits our daughter perfectly and feels like the perfect way to honour the greatest Wildlife Warrior to have ever lived."</p><p id=ehoUqdwLpU data-wc=62><a class=hm-link href=#>Since Grace's birth in 2021</a>, the zookeeper has watched her husband Chandler Powell become an incredible father to their daughter. "It fills my heart with joy," she said. Three years ago, the <a class=hm-link href=#>couple were married during an intimate ceremony</a> at the zoo - with several of the animals taking starring roles. Now, the Australian has set her heart on renewing their vows.</p><p id=eQ9hEFYcTz data-wc=21>Here Bindi speaks her mind about <a class=hm-link href=#>taking on her dad's mission</a>, changing the world and <a class=hm-link href=#>raising her family at Australia Zoo</a>…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/002b1dfbe677-gettyimages-77794217.jpg><h2>Why do you describe yourself as a Wildlife Warrior and is this the sweet reason you gave your daughter Grace the middle name Warrior?</h2><p id=ekU3L74EH1 data-wc=57>My dad first came up with the term 'Wildlife Warrior' many years ago. He wrote it in big letters and stuck it up on his desk. It perfectly describes our family, our mission and who we are at the very core. Being a Wildlife Warrior means standing up and speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves.</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-celebrities -style-2"><p id=e0ezAGt6ZE0>The name Grace Warrior suits our daughter perfectly and feels like the perfect way to honour the greatest Wildlife Warrior to have ever lived, my dad.</p>Bindi Irwin</figure><p id=eA8lLxdW6L data-wc=89>Before our beautiful daughter was born we couldn't decide on a name for her. We actually talked about 'Daisy' for a long time in honour of our darling alligator at Australia Zoo. However, when Grace was born my first words as I held her in my arms were that she's our 'graceful warrior'. Chandler and I immediately knew that should be her name. The name Grace Warrior suits our daughter perfectly and feels like the perfect way to honour the greatest Wildlife Warrior to have ever lived, my dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45b6ea12734c-kb22-bindichandlergracewithbrandi-7521.jpg><h2>What has been your experience of being a mum and bringing up Grace around the wildlife at Australia Zoo?</h2><p id=egmxZ3gere data-wc=63>My hope is that Grace has empathy for all species, and a genuine appreciation for our Earth. I have watched her develop a gentleness towards animals. It makes my heart happy seeing her admire an ant, gently pat a koala or try to feed a tiny tortoise with her spoon. She’s such a strong girl with a real softness towards the natural world.</p><h2>How have you been sharing your love of wildlife with her?</h2><p id=eIXYGyZi0U data-wc=39>Grace already loves animals so much that it's easy to share the wonder of animals together. I'm excited knowing that as she gets older we will be able to impart little gems of information about each animal she meets.</p><h2>What has been the most wonderful thing about seeing your husband become a dad?</h2><p id=exz8UCLC-N data-wc=76>Chandler is an extraordinary husband and watching him become a dad fills my heart with joy. He is such a kind-hearted, patient person, which makes him the best dad. Grace adores Chandler and has endless fun running around with him. It's wonderful that we can be together so much of the time since Australia Zoo is a family-run business. Grace comes to zoo meetings with us and we joke that she makes all the big decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/76ed39ab1073-kb22-bindichandlergracewithbrandi-7554.jpg><h2>Do you have plans to expand your family in the future?</h2><p id=eqFJWp33j9 data-wc=72>Of course, you never know what the future holds. My pregnancy was difficult and we feel very, very lucky to have Grace. We count our blessings every day to have her in our lives. Society places so much pressure on families, and in particular women, when it comes to having children without really knowing their journey. I believe this needs to change as you never know the challenges someone has gone through.</p><h2>What hopes do you have for your daughter's future and do you hope she will continue your family's legacy with wildlife conservation?</h2><p id=eYOX4eaq2A data-wc=53>My hope is that our daughter will follow her heart in life and pursue a path that brings her fulfilment and happiness. No matter what she decides to do, I want her to know that I'll always be cheering for her and will be there if she needs a shoulder to lean on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7eaa133654d7-kb22-bindichandlerwithdingoes-7362.jpg><h2>How do you think your dad Steve would feel now if he could see how you are getting on now with all the wonderful work you have done with helping wildlife?</h2><p id=eA2w29CJKe data-wc=66>I hope he would be proud of what we have achieved for conservation. It's hard to believe it's been over 16 years since he passed away. In some ways, it still feels like yesterday that we were on our last crocodile research trip together as a family. I know in my heart that his love and enthusiasm will live on and that brings me great comfort.&nbsp;</p><h2>What conservation is Australia Zoo doing now and how will it make a positive difference in the world?</h2><p id=edTLIPcmLj data-wc=44>We have an extraordinary team who work to educate and inspire our guests to appreciate the natural world. We have vital endangered species breeding programs, daily educational talks, school experiences, tours, volunteer initiatives, and a passion to bring exciting education to everyone who visits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43c207946580-kb22-bindiandchandlerwithreptiles-8903.jpg><h2>How are you carrying on your dad Steve Irwin's mission to save wildlife?</h2><p id=ehOPCVrUjg data-wc=53>We work hard to ensure Dad's mission continues to grow, just like he wanted us to do. He always used to say, "I don't care if people remember me, I want everyone to remember my mission". Through our work both at Australia Zoo and Wildlife Warriors, conservation through exciting education is our ethos.</p><p id=e2eRpT7Os4 data-wc=81>We support projects around the world protecting wildlife. In Africa we work with three organisations. The Black Mambas, an all female army trained anti poaching team working within the Greater Kruger National Park in South Africa. Ol Pejeta Conservancy protects the critically endangered black rhinos with specially trained K-9 Units working alongside the rangers. Cheetah Outreach’s Guarding Dog Program, where Anatolian Shepherd dogs are placed with herds of livestock, to deter predators, in particular saving cheetahs from being shot by farmers.</p><p id=eHsxwdALgp data-wc=50>In Sumatra we have two very important projects with tigers and elephants. We help to employ 60 full-time forest rangers who patrol the jungle and dismantle illegal tiger snare traps. Through Australia Zoo we have built an enormous elephant hospital in Sumatra, to treat and care for elephants in need.</p><p id=e850mYm3YA data-wc=27>My mum grew up in Oregon, USA, so we support a brilliant wildlife organisation, Wildlife Images which has a hospital treating approximately 1,200 wild animals each year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/96daa3c7342e-kb22-bindiandchandlerwithchlroos-8630.jpg><p id=eJxbgTECpb data-wc=99>Here in Australia we have many projects. We support whale shark research alongside Ecocean, learning about this enormous and secretive species. We fund the largest crocodile research program in the world alongside The University of Queensland, using state-of-the-art acoustic and satellite trackers. Our Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital and Rescue Unit has treated over 120,000 patients and continues to expand utilising cutting edge medical treatments for the wildlife that comes into our care. We also have three conservation properties within Australia which adds up to about half a million acres of pristine land, set aside for protection of native species.</p><h2>How many animals have been saved at Australia Zoo Wildlife hospital and what positive impact has this had?</h2><p id=eYo7D80h00 data-wc=52>We've treated over 120,000 animals. Our philosophy is 'save one, save the species'. The goal with every animal brought into care is to give them the best chance at life in the wild once again. It's humbling to know that with so many animals treated, we are helping to save entire species.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4fc7e5d526a-kb22-bindichandlerwithechidna-7629.jpg><h2>Why should everyone celebrate World Earth Day and how will you celebrate it at Australia Zoo?</h2><p id=eizPiyMDrj data-wc=128>Personally, I believe we should treat every day like it's World Earth Day. We only have this one beautiful, green planet and our very survival depends on us caring for it. World Earth Day is a fantastic reminder to stop and appreciate our wonderful world while giving us all that push to think about our own impact. At Australia Zoo our entire year feels like World Earth Day. We strive to inspire every one of our guests to love and respect the species we live alongside. Our team of 400 works incredibly hard to impart the conservation message in an exciting way so people walk away with a sense of purpose and passion to protect the natural world. Our hearts beat for conservation every minute of every day.</p><h2>What are you most proud of with your work at Australia Zoo and why?</h2><p id=eZE_kPXQwz data-wc=79>It can be very easy to get overwhelmed when you look at everything stacked against our world's wildlife and wild places. Deforestation, the illegal wildlife trade, resource depletion, climate change, sometimes it feels easy to fall apart under the weight of it all. I'm most proud to be continuing to try to share the message of conservation in a positive way. If we can all do something, the world will be a brighter place for the generations to come.</p><h2>How do you keep a special bond and close connection with the animals?</h2><p id=e8FMRyf1nl data-wc=117>We feel lucky to have such a large family of animals. Australia Zoo is like a resort for wildlife and we strive to create remarkable habitats for our animal family. I think the most important aspect of working with wildlife is always keeping the awe in your heart for every species. If you've spent five minutes or five years with an animal, it's vital to never lose that genuine love, respect and appreciation for them. It is such a privilege to work with wildlife, especially as closely as we all do at Australia Zoo. They're part of our family and it's an honour to share them with our guests to instil a greater understanding for all species.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1849e537b272-photo-25-3-20-2-10-12-pm.jpg><h2>What would you like to achieve next in your personal life and at Australia Zoo?</h2><p id=esB55fZNOn6 data-wc=57><a class=hm-link href=#>Chandler and I got married</a> in the midst of the 2020 lockdowns due to the pandemic. We weren't able to have family and friends join us for the wedding. Personally, I'd love to renew our vows one day when Grace is older. It would be lovely to have our closest friends and family with us to celebrate.</p><p id=eTsNg6U9K0 data-wc=68>At Australia Zoo, I'm excited for The Crocodile Hunter Lodge to continue to expand with even more accommodation options. Dad's big dream for the future was to create conservation luxury accommodation like no other for our guests. We opened the lodge and Warrior Restaurant last year which felt like such a win. With his dream accomplished, I’m excited for the addition of more cabin options including three-bedroom cabins.</p><p id=eWQRTqQW9t data-wc=36>I would also love for Australia Zoo to be home to an outstanding platypus sanctuary. Platypus are some of my very favourite animals and they’re having a hard time in the wild due to human impact.</p><h2>Have the numbers returned for visiting at the zoo after the Covid pandemic? How can everyone help support zoos and why is this help vital for wildlife and the planet?</h2><p id=erKf710pFh data-wc=70>We are tremendously thankful to be reopened after being shut down for over 70 days during lockdown. It was such a terrifying time not knowing if our doors would ever be opened again. Our cost just to feed our animals is over $80,000 a week, so with no guests, we were worried what would happen. We're thankful that we are able to welcome guests from around the world once again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac94bfaf5fca-photo-25-3-20-2-51-02-pm.jpg><p id=e_gcK00VjH data-wc=61>Australia Zoo is a conservation hub, I think it is important to remember to support facilities that are genuinely working hard to do good for our planet and the animals that they care for. Using your funds to visit places that are doing their part to protect the planet, is one way you can help make a difference in the world.</p><h2>Your wedding photos looked incredible - what was it like tying the knot at Australia Zoo in2020, with many of the animals you love being able to be a part of your special day in someway?</h2><p id=eDOekzsqx4 data-wc=68>Our animals are part of our family. Even though we couldn't have all the human guests we wanted a tour wedding, we were grateful to spend the day with the wildlife we love so dearly. Getting married during the pandemic was certainly a strange experience, but an important reminder that love always wins. And now, we have our gorgeous daughter which makes persevering with our wedding even sweeter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b956f95f70fe-photo-25-3-20-2-59-51-pm.jpg><h2>What was special for you to choose a wedding dress inspired by your mother’s own bridal dress?</h2><p id=eTo17gYVjC data-wc=63>Ever since I was a little girl I've known that I wanted a wedding dress similar to my mum's gorgeous gown. Her dress has been in the family for almost 60 years. It was really meaningful to work with a family-run, 100% Australian wedding dress boutique, Paddington Weddings. They were so kind to create a dress even more perfect than I had imagined.</p><h2>How did you pay tribute to your dad on your wedding day?</h2><p id=eFVP6JeLsJ data-wc=59>On the day we had a candle-lighting ceremony in honour of Dad, alongside my favourite photo of him and our family dog, Sui. It meant the world to pay tribute to his memory on our special day. I’d also like to mention my incredible brother who walked me down the aisle. I'm forever thankful for his friendship and support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3df19b2a44c6-photo-25-3-20-6-45-46-pm.jpg><h2>What easy changes can people make to be more environmentally friendly?</h2><p id=eW8by5YiiY data-wc=61>Simple things like swapping out your laundry detergent/dish soap for greener alternatives, turning off the tap while you brush your teeth, composting, recycling, donating used items, planting a garden, shopping local, setting up bird feeders or bee boxes and seeking out companies with environmentally driven products. The options are endless and every little action adds up to make a big difference.</p><h2>How can people be kinder to the planet?</h2><p id=e3ZSdAbqh1- data-wc=106>There are many ways to show kindness towards our Mother Earth. We all lead such different lives, it's important to find what works best for you and your lifestyle. If everyone does the best they can do to reduce their footprint, the world will be a much brighter place for the generations to come. One of the biggest conservation stands you can take is to never purchase any wildlife products. When the buying stops, the killing can, too. Check your pet food for wildlife products like kangaroo meat, avoid fashion brands that promote skins or fur and make informed food choices when at the grocery store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0d2f44ac246-photo-25-3-20-7-05-09-pm.jpg><p id=eQSpAj_Hh0 data-wc=47>Volunteering your time to an environmental organisation is an enormous help and donating funds is incredibly beneficial. We run the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital and our non profit conservation organisation, Wildlife Warriors, and I can tell you first-hand that donations of time and funds are tremendously appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJ3CdzNsi3 data-wc=64>There are also many small acts of kindness you can show in everyday life to protect the planet. Saying 'yes' to reusable items like water bottles and 'no' to single-use plastics. Planting native flowers or trees, organising local clean-up days at the park or beach, swapping that archaic hunting trip for a meaningful photography adventure, educating and inspiring others to care for our Earth.</p><p id=e3EydST_G-W data-wc=3></p><p id=e5QIcHOdNl_ data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
