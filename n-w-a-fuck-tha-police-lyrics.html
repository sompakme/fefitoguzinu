Comin' straight from the underground<br>A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown<br>And not the other color, so police think<br>They have the authority to kill a minority<br>Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one<br>For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun<br>To be beating on, and thrown in jail<br>We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell<br>Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager<br>With a little bit of gold and a pager<br>Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product<br>Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics<br>You'd rather see me in the pen<br>Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o<br>Beat a police out of shape<br>And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape<br>To tape off the scene of the slaughter<br>Still getting swole off bread and water<br>I don't know if they fags or what<br>Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts<br>And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none<br>But don't let it be a black and a white one<br>‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top<br>Black police showing out for the white cop<br>Ice Cube will swarm<br>On any motherfucker in a blue uniform<br>Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT<br>Punk police are afraid of me<br>Huh, a young nigga on the warpath<br>And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath<br>Of cops, dying in L.A<br>Yo, Dre, I got something to say</p><p>[Hook]<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!</p><p>[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]<br>Pull your goddamn ass over right now!<br>Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?<br>‘Cause I feel like it!<br>Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!<br>Man, fuck this shit!<br>A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!<br>MC Ren, will you please give your testimony<br>To the jury about this fucked up incident?</p><p>[Verse 2: MC Ren]<br>Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority<br>Because the niggas on the street is a majority<br>A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'<br>And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in<br>A stash spot, for the so-called law<br>Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw<br>Lights start flashing behind me<br>But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me<br>But that shit don't work, I just laugh<br>Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path<br>For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!"<br>Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk<br>Pulling out a silly club, so you stand<br>With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand<br>But take off the gun so you can see what's up<br>And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!<br>Make you think I'ma kick your ass<br>But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast<br>I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime<br>But I'ma smoke them now and not next time<br>Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me<br>Or any asshole that threatens me<br>I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope<br>Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me<br>The motherfuckin' villain that's mad<br>With potential to get bad as fuck<br>So I'ma turn it around<br>Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound<br>(Gunshot sounds)<br>Yeah, somethin' like that<br>But it all depends on the size of the gat<br>Taking out a police would make my day<br>But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…</p><p>[Hook]<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!</p><p>[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]<br>(Knocking sounds)<br>Yeah, man, what you need?<br>Police, open out!<br>Aww, shit<br>We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest<br>Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!<br>(Move, motherfucker, move now!)<br>What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?<br>Just shut the fuck up<br>And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!<br>(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)<br>But I didn't do shit<br>Man, just shut the fuck up!<br>Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand<br>And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?</p><p>[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]<br>I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'<br>Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and<br>Shining the light in my face, and for what?<br>Maybe it's because I kick so much butt<br>I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast<br>On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger<br>Of an Uzi or an AK<br>‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say<br>They put out my picture with silence<br>‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence<br>The E with the criminal behavior<br>Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor<br>Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?<br>A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot<br>By me, or another nigga<br>And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger<br>(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)<br>And as you all know, E's here to rule<br>Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror<br>And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a<br>Dumb motherfucker with a gun<br>And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one<br>That I take out, and then get away<br>While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say</p><p>[Hook]<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!<br>Fuck tha police!</p><p>[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]<br>The verdict:<br>The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck<br>White bread, chickenshit motherfucker<br>Wait, that's a lie!
