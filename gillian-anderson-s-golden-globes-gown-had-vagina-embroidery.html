However, upon closer inspection, the Gabriela Hearst creation actually had subtle vagina-inspired embroidery on the voluminous skirt.

"It's brand appropriate." At a second stop on the red carpet, Anderson told&nbsp;People&nbsp;that the design was floral, saying, "It’s covered in peonies!" Whether the monochromatic design was vaginal or floral, it took a long, long time to complete. In a statement from the brand, Hearst and her team revealed that each design took more than three hours to complete — and the raw-edged skirt was covered in them. Anderson finished the look with a round handbag with a rigid handle and Chopard jewelry.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amy Sussman/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While she's no stranger to the red carpet — especially since her show,&nbsp;The Crown, racked up nominations and a win tonight for Elizabeth Debicki, she got real about how she stays comfortable when she's not in the spotlight.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't wear a bra anymore.
