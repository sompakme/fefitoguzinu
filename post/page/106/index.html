<a href=../../../brett-lauderdale-comments-on-reports-of-gcw-partnering-with-wwe.html></a>
It’s quite obvious that WWE is one of the biggest professional wrestling promotions in the world. With a global audience spanning in the millions, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that other wrestling promotions would want to partner with WWE. However, WWE has also been independent of any external partnerships.
However, recent reports have emerged that indicate WWE may be looking to work together with Game Change Wrestling.

When it comes to history's most notorious serial killers, Ted Bundy is nothing short of murderous royalty. Between 1974 and 1978 he killed more than 30 people, often using good looks and charm to lure good samaritans to their deaths. According to Men's Health, his January 24, 1989 execution was the sort of event that everyone stopped, watched, and waited for news on.&nbsp;Bundy had actually gotten the death penalty for three separate trials, and still, he spent nine years in prison before someone actually flipped the switch on the electric chair at the Florida State Penitentiary, and when he was taken out of the prison, the crowds lining the streets outside cheered as the car bearing his body drove past.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do I wash my sand cloud towel?</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

I can’t always handle&nbsp;horror movies.&nbsp;Between the unexpected gore it'll sometimes throw at you—I'm looking at you,&nbsp;American Horror Story—and the jump-scares that exist solely to make you, you know, jump? No thanks. So when I want to feel a little freaked out, I watch true crime shows. Sometimes they're gory, but in that archival footage/"based on a true story" way that’s a little less visceral (also, nothing jumps out at me).
