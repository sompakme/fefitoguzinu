I'd missed her first steps. I didn't know she could walk. I'd missed everything, chasing fame that didn't matter anyway. I got on the phone on the way home and told my manager 'I'm never doing this again'. I quit that day and I've never really been back." At the time of the interview, Astley had started again occasionally appearing in '80s revival shows, little knowing that the <a href=#>phenomenon of "Rickrolling"</a> was going to give him a whole kind of fame.</p><p>Per <a href=#>Fox News</a>, the tradition of "Rick-rolling," or performing a bait and switch by claiming to link to one thing but instead linking to the "Never Gonna Give You Up" video, originated with the website 4chan. It went mainstream on April Fool's&nbsp;Day 2008 when YouTube linked every supposed "featured video" to "Never Gonna Give You Up" and has since become a time-honored internet tradition. Astley has released several new albums since 2016 and has even been Rickrolled himself, according to <a href=#>Time</a>. Per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Rick Astley has a net worth of $16 million. "Never Gonna Give You Up" was, according to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, Google's&nbsp;second most-hummed song of 2020, which is an honor that is priceless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkG9pcmtfnbKzsdJmn6ivXaLCpLSMq6Cco12WwLW4xLJkoqtdrLyzwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gangsta-boo-net-worth-2024-updated-wealth-of-the-rapper.html><span>←</span><span>Gangsta Boo Net Worth 2024: Updated Wealth Of The Rapper</span></a>
