Moreover, Bladee, Ecco2k, and Thaiboy Digital just dropped the song "TL;DR" on streaming services (produced by Whitearmor) after they released its music video, shot by the first artist's brother Gus Reinwald, just last week. This continues a solid 2024 for Bladee, who just dropped his collaborative album with Yung Lean, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Psykos</a>, last March. As for Ecco and Thaiboy, this is the first thing that either of them have released to DSPs in a while, which is very exciting.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, to give an example to easily convey what makes this song so engaging, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a> fans should definitely tap into Drain Gang if they haven't already. This beat is a perfect introduction: relentless but backdropped hi-hats, addictive synth timbres, cavernous bass, crisp percs and snares, plus ethereal vocal effects. It ends up striking a difficult balance between nocturnal moodiness and intoxicated hype, something that a synth switch towards the end plus additional elements really help illustrate. Lyrically, Bladee, Ecco2k, and Thaiboy Digital call back to some of their previous cult classics and proclaim that this cut is for the "real fanatics" who love songs and projects like "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">For You</a>," <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The Fool</a>, or even earlier. We won't spoil them here, unfortunately.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drain-gang-s-back-stream-amp-watch-the-music-video-for-bladee-ecco2k-amp-thaiboy-digital-s-tl-dr>Drain Gang's Back: Stream & Watch The Music Video For Bladee, Ecco2k & Thaiboy Digital's "TL;DR"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, their tradeoff is also well-balanced: the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Enemy</a>" creative opens and ends, Ecco2k has a cold-blooded verse, and Thaiboy Digital brings some of that repetitive hypnosis and opulence. Needless to say, we can't wait to see where Bladee and the rest of Drain Gang take us next. If you haven't heard "TL;DR," find it on your preferred streaming service and peep some standout bars below. Let us know what you think of it in the comments, and make sure to check out the music video above.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbn5yf5NmmaWZlJqybrHCnKZro12ptaK1waiwZpyZnLa1rctmq6WcomKxs63Ip2SgmZ6ceq%2Bx1maqqKaXYsC1vsSapGagmaV6qbvPZqWer6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-rebellious-royal-hen-and-stag-dos-princess-kate-s-bodysuit-sarah-ferguson-s-police-scare-and-mo.html><span>←</span><span>10 rebellious royal hen and stag dos: Princess Kate's bodysuit, Sarah Ferguson's police scare and mo</span></a>
