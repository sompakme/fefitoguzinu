Now he can focus on his tennis and he is still a top eight player remember, so he’s part of the ATP Finals in London,” the former world No 4 told <strong>Sky Sports</strong>.</p><p>“To finish the year in the top 10 by not playing his best tennis is a great achievement.</p><p>“I hope he can get it together for 2020 because if I can pick a player that I think that can make it, then it would be Sascha. With the combination with Roger, he can learn a lot.</p><p>“Roger is aware of Sascha’s game; he knows what he is doing wrong and knows how he can improve. Everything Roger does, he does 100 per cent, so I think he’s 100 per cent behind Sascha otherwise he wouldn’t sign him. Remember that he is still very young.”</p><p><strong>Like our <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook page</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=# rel=noopener>@T365Official</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGiYrahdqby2vo6noJynnJbAbrfInp2eql2WuabEwKebnqpdr8OmvsSvZJyZnmLBtr7NZquhoZ6cwG6t0aisp5xdrLa1tIyrpqCdomKzprDEq5yrq12dsq28</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./muscatine-animal-nonprofit-gets-7-690-grant.html><span>←</span><span>Muscatine animal nonprofit gets $7,690 grant</span></a>
