Over the weekend, fans at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, and the superstar singer herself, were graced by the presence of Adele's doctor, the man who happened to deliver her child. During an impromptu pause in the song —&nbsp;Adele was overcome with emotion at seeing Dr. Colin —&nbsp;she shared that she was "desperate" to have a second child.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh my God, Colin," the singer said mid-song, which was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>captured</a>&nbsp;by a fan. "Oh, my God. This is my doctor that gave birth to my baby. I haven't seen you in years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was choked up and asked the audience to continue the song ("Will you sing it for me? That man delivered my baby," she said.) while she hugged her doctor. Adele and her ex, Simon Konecki, welcomed a son together, Angelo, in October 2012. They split in 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm desperate for another baby, Colin," Adele&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the crowd</a>, according to another video.

"I've actually been writing lists. So, every time I see a name that I like, I write it down in my phone."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2022, Adele told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle</a>&nbsp;that she wanted to give Angelo a sibling. "I definitely want more kids," she shared before starting her residency in Sin City. "I’m a homemaker and I’m a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music. Right now, all I got in my brain is Vegas. I want to fucking nail it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adele's boyfriend, Rich Paul, has three children of his own. He spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E!
