What's really going on in the Charlotte music scene? It was fake. It was a hoax, n***a. Some parts was real, but it was definitely heavily fabricated after the fact," says Coldheart about the fight. "That's Hollywood for you. Everything I said after that shit happened, everything on the internet for the past year was for money, you feel me. N***a in Hollywood you have to put on a show to make money, you hear? This rap shit is not street. It's about money, period. We done got all the media money. So now back to reality.
