Such reactions are not rare. Neurologic agitation is estimated to occur in 10 to 25 percent of patients, and muscle spasms in 10 percent."<h2>Can you stay on Prozac for life?</h2>Sharing the Research: When patients ask about the long-term use of antidepressant medication, the truth is there really isn't any. Prozac has been around since the 1980s but published long-term studies of antidepressant medications range from 3 to 15 years.<h2>Why you should not take Prozac?</h2>The FDA requires Prozac to come with a black box warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25 years.

Clinicians generally recommend staying on the medication for six to nine months before considering going off antidepressants.<h2>Can you stop Prozac cold turkey?</h2>The best way to stop taking your medication is not by abruptly stopping, it's by slowly tapering the medication while under a doctor's supervision. No two people will respond to tapering off SSRIs the same way. Talk with your doctor to come up with a plan that works best for you and your treatment goals.<h2>Does Prozac cause dementia?</h2>According to the study, popular Prozac-like pills known as SSRIs — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors — and other antidepressants are associated with a twofold increase in the odds of developing some form of dementia, including Alzheimer's.<h2>Does Prozac affect memory?</h2>Finding of the study supports the concept that long-term use of fluoxetine does not impair memory and psychomotor function but improves it significantly.

If it's almost time to take your next pill, however, skip the missed dose and take the next one as scheduled. Don't take more than one dose at a time.<h2>How do I wean off Prozac 10 mg?</h2>Prozac Tapering Guidelines Include:<p>You can cut the 10 mg pills in half for smaller dosing. You can even try to cut them smaller. Prozac is rather forgiving if the cuts are not exact. Dosage cuts have to be adjusted for personal tolerance and sensitivity, but a good range would be in the 10-25% range.</p><h2>Should I take Prozac in the morning or at night?</h2>For some conditions Prozac is used to treat, it's recommended to take the drug in the morning.
