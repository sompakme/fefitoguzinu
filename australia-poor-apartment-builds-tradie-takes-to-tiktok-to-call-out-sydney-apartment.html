The video shows a large, uneven gap between that and the tiles it is supposed to sit flush with.</p><p>“Look at the workmanship – it’s just f**king garbage,” he exclaimed.</p><p>He then moved on to some rattly doors covered in uneven blotches of paint.</p><p>“Everywhere you go, it’s like a kid done it,” he said</p><p>“This is what you get these days in Sydney.”</p><p>The tiler said the building industry needed to change, and there were numerous new homes around the city just like it.</p><p>“They’re taking people’s money and building it s**t,” he said.</p><p>“If people want to build an apartment and take people’s money there should be some security.”</p><p>The tiler floated the idea of a one-year cooling off period after people move into the apartment.</p><p>Worryingly, the video is one of many circulating social media.</p><p>President of the Australian Society of Building Consultants David Roberts believed since the NSW Government’s <a class=body-link href=# title=legislation.nsw.gov.au>Design and Building Practitioners Act </a>came into affect earlier this year, it was now harder for builders and developers to pass off poor class two (apartments) builds.</p><p>Through a range of measures, the Act sought to restore consumer confidence to make sure that apartments being built properly and to the highest of standards.</p><p>“The building commissioner's office is getting stuck into these dodgy builders and developers that have been wreaking havoc for years,” Mr Roberts told news.com.au.</p><p>“There is a multitude of buildings that need to be fixed or are still having issues from prior to July last year when the practitioners act came into play.</p><p>Mr Roberts said ultimately it came down to poor supervision over subcontractors.</p><p>“There’s a foreman on site some of the time but the rest of the time, subbies are just doing their own thing,” he said.</p><p>High-profile Australian architect Tone Wheeler wrote in a <a class=body-link href=# title=www.architectureanddesign.com.au>architecture column in 2019</a> that the Australian housing market had become “flooded” with poorly built apartments.</p><p>“The owners’ corporations try to hide the problems in the hope that the building doesn’t get a bad reputation, so that the strata owners can sell again, at a profit, without the defects being addressed,” he said.</p><p>“The purchaser is dudded with a poor product, the developer is dudded with a loss of profit, so who benefits? Banks.</p><p>“They make money at every turn, in the construction loan and in the first and subsequent mortgages.”</p><p>Mr Wheeler said selling off-plan was the “scourge of building good units”.</p><p>“The builders hate it as it lowers their profit, purchasers hate it as they rarely get what they are expecting.”</p><p>In July Aussie building inspector Zeher Khalil’s <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c6db24a8361c6ab1c2111f0efc2a4653 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>went viral for his videos exposing</a> the dodgy workmanship of tradies on new homes – most of them in Melbourne.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvSspunnaliu7TDjp%2BioqaXYrSivsGanp5lpKeupbXEZpyxqJ%2BosrR50qGmp6OpYq%2Bzrc2dZKedp2K1sLnErGannaeoerTAzquwaJ5pZ7B5fcCbaWptYZmFdLDEbm5ummhss3WwlGlnamti</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-aquino-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Aquino Net Worth</span></a>
