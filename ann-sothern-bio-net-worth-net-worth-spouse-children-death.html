Lake, worked as an importer and exporter, while her mother, Annette Yde, was a singer who performed mostly at concerts.&nbsp;Ann Sothern and her two younger sisters were raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&nbsp;She attended Central High School in Minneapolis and later went on to college at the University of Washington in Seattle, although she dropped out after a year.</span></p><p><span>She was very good at the piano which she started learning when she was five years old.&nbsp;Ann even studied at the McPhail School of Music where her mother was a teacher.&nbsp;She excelled in music composition winning Minnesota’s annual competition for student-level music composers for three consecutive years while still in high school.&nbsp;After her parents divorced, her mother moved to Los Angeles as a voice coach for the prestigious Warner Bros.&nbsp;Studio.</span></p><p>Ann Sothern began her film career in 1927extras in the film “Broadway Nights”, and then in other films.&nbsp;She continued to do bit parts until 1933, when she was cast by Columbia Pictures in “Let’s Fall in Love.”&nbsp;Harry Cohn, co-founder and president of Columbia Pictures at the time, changed her name to Ann Sothern, Harriette Arlene Lake, in memory of her mother and EH Sothern (American Shakespearian actor).&nbsp;After being dropped by Columbia Pictures in 1936, she left for RKO, although the jobs she held remained tied to low-budget commercial films, such as the one she had acquired from Columbia Pictures.</p><p><span>In 1938, she got her first major breakthrough soon after in ‘Trade Winds’ which landed her a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.&nbsp;The following year, she got her first main role in “Maisie”, which would become a successful series until 1947. In 1953, after having appeared in several successful films, she appeared on television in “Private Secretary”.&nbsp;The following year, after the cancellation of Private Secretary, the American actress starred in “Ann Sothern Show,” another sitcom she made for Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).&nbsp;She also worked as a voice artist in the lead role in “My Mother the Car”, a comedy show.</span></p><p>The Hollywood star retired to her home in Ketchum, Idaho in 1987 due to health issues.&nbsp;His last appearance in the film “The Whales of August” earned him an Oscar nomination.</p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>After a successful career of nearly 60 years in film and television, the talented American actress was able to build up great wealth.&nbsp;His net worth was placed somewhere around an estimated worth of $16 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ann Sothern, wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ann married American actor Roger Pryor in 1936.&nbsp;They then finalized their divorce in May 1943, two years after they separated over allegations of cruelty.&nbsp;Their union produced no offspring.&nbsp;Shortly after divorcing Roger, she married Robert Sterling, a film and television actor.</span></p><p><span>Ann Sothern had only one child in her life, and that was with Robert Sterling.&nbsp;Patricia Ann ‘Tisha’ Sterling was born on December 10, 1944 in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;Just like her parents, she became an actress.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>There has been a lot of speculation regarding the body measurements of the multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominee.&nbsp;Ann Sothern can’t be said to be tall with a height of 5ft 1in.&nbsp;She weighed 67 kg while, according to rumours, she would have gained weight a little before her death.&nbsp;Her bust and hips measured 35 and 36 inches respectively.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ann’s death</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Golden Globe Award winner died at her home in Ketchum, Idaho on March 15, 2001. According to medical reports, she died of congestive heart failure.&nbsp;She was 92 when she died and was buried in Ketchum Cemetery.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnqN6tLvToZyrpl2XtrB5zJ6YrK2imrqmutOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWSsqJ%2BqwKZ5wqGgpZyimrtusMSaq6Fn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyson-hannigan-movies-and-tv-shows-where-you-might-know-her-from.html><span>←</span><span>Alyson Hannigan movies and TV shows: where you might know her from</span></a>
