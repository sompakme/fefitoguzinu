<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Jonathan Majors' Ex-Girlfriend Accused of Domestic Violence</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Grace Jabbari Arrested</strong>:- Grace Jabbari, the ex-girlfriend of actor Jonathan Majors, was arrested on June 28, 2023, for allegedly assaulting Majors at his home in Los Angeles. According to the police report, Jabbari showed up at Majors’ residence uninvited and started an argument with him. She then allegedly punched him in the face, scratched his neck, and threw a vase at him, causing minor injuries. Majors called 911 and Jabbari was taken into custody.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Grace_Jabbari></span>Who is Grace Jabbari?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Grace Jabbari is a 32-year-old model and actress who dated Jonathan Majors from 2019 to 2021. They met on the set of the Netflix series The Last Black Man in San Francisco, where Majors played the lead role of Jimmie Fails and Jabbari had a minor role as a waitress. They were seen together at several red carpet events and social media posts, but they never confirmed their relationship publicly.</p><p>Jabbari has appeared in several other films and TV shows, such as The Hate U Give, Insecure, and Black-ish. She is also a spokesperson for a beauty brand and a vegan activist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Grace_Jabbari_and_Jonathan_Majors_break_up></span>Why did Grace Jabbari, and Jonathan Majors break up?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to sources close to the couple, Majors and Jabbari broke up in early 2021 due to their busy schedules and different career goals. Majors, who rose to fame after starring in HBO’s Lovecraft Country and Marvel’s Loki, was reportedly focused on his acting projects and wanted to keep his personal life private. Jabbari, on the other hand, wanted more attention and recognition from the media and the public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-did-Grace-Jabbari-and-Jonathan-Majors-break-up.jpg><p>The sources also claimed that Jabbari was jealous of Majors’ success and co-stars, especially Jurnee Smollett, who played his love interest in Lovecraft Country. She allegedly accused him of cheating on her multiple times and tried to sabotage his reputation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Allegations_Against_Jonathan_Majors></span>The Allegations Against Jonathan Majors<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Majors, who is set to star in Creed III and play Kang the Conqueror in Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was arrested on March 25 by the NYPD after officers responded to a 911 call from Jabbari. She claimed that Majors had broken her finger, twisted her arm, and struck her in the ear, causing it to bleed.&nbsp;She was taken to a hospital for treatment and Majors was charged with assault and harassment on multiple counts.</p><p>Majors pleaded not guilty to the charges and maintained his innocence throughout the case.&nbsp;His lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, said that Majors was “provably the victim” and that Jabbari had attacked him first while she was drunk and hysterical. Chaudhry also said that there was surveillance footage and photos that supported Majors’ version of events.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Counter-Complaint_by_Majors></span>The Counter-Complaint by Majors<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 21, 2023, Majors filed a domestic violence complaint against Jabbari at the Chinatown precinct, where he gave his own account of what happened that night.&nbsp;According to a domestic incident report and sworn affidavit obtained by Insider, Majors alleged that Jabbari scratched, slapped, and grabbed at his face, causing pain and bleeding.</p><p>Majors also said that Jabbari had been drinking heavily and was upset about their breakup. He said that he tried to calm her down and walk her home, but she became violent and aggressive.&nbsp;He said that he only defended himself and did not harm her intentionally.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_current_status_of_their_relationship></span>What is the current status of their relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Majors and Jabbari have not been in contact since their breakup, except for a few legal matters. In April 2021, Majors filed a restraining order against Jabbari, claiming that she had been stalking him, sending him threatening messages, and showing up at his home and workplace without his consent. He also alleged that she had physically abused him during their relationship, leaving him with bruises and scars.</p><p>Jabbari denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim against Majors, accusing him of defamation, emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. She also demanded $10 million in damages from him.</p><p>The case is still pending in court and both parties have hired lawyers to represent them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Arrest_of_Grace_Jabbari></span>The Arrest of Grace Jabbari<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After reviewing the evidence and conducting their own investigation, the NYPD found probable cause to arrest Jabbari for assaulting Majors.&nbsp;They issued an electronic document called an “I-Card” that directed police to take Jabbari into custody, at least for questioning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Arrest-of-Grace-Jabbari.jpg><p>However, the Manhattan prosecutors who were pursuing the case against Majors were reluctant to charge Jabbari, and asked the police to deactivate the “I-Card”.&nbsp;Chaudhry told Insider that the DA’s office had repeatedly pushed back against investigating or charging Jabbari, despite the supporting evidence.</p><p>On June 27, 2023, Jabbari was finally arrested by the NYPD after they received a warrant from a judge. She was charged with assault and harassment on multiple counts, similar to Majors.&nbsp;She was released on bail and is awaiting trial.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Implications_for_Majors></span>The Implications for Majors<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The arrest of Jabbari is a major win for Majors, who has been facing public scrutiny and backlash since his initial arrest.&nbsp;His lawyer said that he was grateful to the NYPD detectives for their efforts and hoped that the truth would come out in court.</p><p>Majors is still scheduled to appear in court on August 3, 2023, for his trial on the charges brought by Jabbari.&nbsp;However, his lawyer said that they would seek to have the charges dismissed or reduced in light of Jabbari’s arrest.</p><p>Majors has also been supported by his current girlfriend, actress Meagan Good, who accompanied him to his court appearances.&nbsp;She said that she believed in his innocence and loved him unconditionally.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The domestic violence case involving Jonathan Majors and Grace Jabbari has taken a dramatic turn with the arrest of Jabbari for assaulting Majors. This raises questions about the credibility of Jabbari’s allegations and the fairness of the prosecution against Majors. It also shows how complex and sensitive domestic violence cases can be, especially when they involve celebrities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGilnq%2BjZLSzrcKeZKOZkpeus7WMmqmrnaOpsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-billingsley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>John Billingsley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
