He was 76.</p><p>Feeney died of emphysema on April 16 at a hospice in Carlsbad, Calif., son Tim Feeney said. The elder Feeney lived in San Marcos in San Diego County,</p><p>“He never smoked a day in his life” and the family believes he may have contracted the illness from decades of performing in smoky casinos and nightclubs, his son said.</p><p>From 1957 to 1982, Feeney was the featured tenor on the Welk show, which offered easy-listening “champagne music” and clean-cut, family oriented songs. The shows are still broadcast on public television stations.</p><p>Feeney also had a rich career away from the show. He sang for five presidents at the White House and for Pope Paul VI in 1975 at the Vatican, according to his Web site.</p><p>Feeney, however, was modest.</p><p>“We knew him as dad,” Tim Feeney said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in San Diego. “He came home and never told us he sang for the president.”</p><p>He performed at venues ranging from Carnegie Hall to Disneyland, in part to support a big family.</p><p>“When you have 10 kids, even in those days, things were expensive,” said another son, Sean Feeney of La Costa.</p><p>His last performance was in Syracuse, N.Y., in December.</p><p>“He loved it,” Tim Feeney said of the singing. “It was his life. And that’s what led most of the family to sing and perform throughout the years.”</p><p>Feeney was born to an Irish-American family in Grand Island, Neb., and as a child sang in the church choir. He continued singing through school. He entered and won several singing contests at the University of Nebraska, where he was starting quarterback.</p><p>A tape of his singing was sent to Welk in 1956, resulting in a guest spot on the Los Angeles-based show.</p><p>“From then on, he became a regular,” Sean Feeney said.</p><p>When he wasn’t singing, Feeney loved to fish and golf. He also kept a garden and at one time raised horses on a ranch in Simi Valley, Tim Feeney said.</p><p>In addition to his two sons, Feeney is survived by sons Joe Jr., of Escondido; George Patrick, of Las Vegas; Chris, of Los Angeles, and Matt, of San Diego; daughters Kathy Feeney of Glendale, Ariz. and Georgia Feeney of San Marcos, and nine grandchildren. Two other children died.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmpZmnp7Kvr8Rmrp6km2LBprrOq2Sjp5Vis6axzZ6wZmlhZX5xgI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-holland-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Holland Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
