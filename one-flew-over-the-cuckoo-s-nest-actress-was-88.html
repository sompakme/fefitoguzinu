They offered it to many movie stars who declined, luckily for me. To think, what if somebody else had said yes?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the film, the icy Ratched humiliates her patients and revokes their privileges on a whim. When she can’t control a new arrival, Randle McMurphy (<a href=# id=auto-tag_jack-nicholson data-tag=jack-nicholson>Jack Nicholson</a>), she administers shock therapy on him, then has him lobotomized.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fletcher knew her life had changed forever when she watched Cuckoo’s Nest with an audience for the first time and saw how people reacted to a scene in which McMurphy tries to kill her character.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It was in Chicago, and it was a packed house,” she recalled. “When he strangles her, the audience stood up and yelled and cheered. Stood up. It was unbelievable. I was thrilled.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On its 2003 list of the 100 greatest villains in the annals of motion pictures, the American Film Institute placed Nurse Ratched at No. 5, behind only Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates, Darth Vader and the Wicked Witch of the West. (<a href=# id=auto-tag_sarah-paulson data-tag=sarah-paulson>Sarah Paulson</a> recently revived the character in a Ryan Murphy <a href=# rel=noopener>prequel series</a> for Netflix.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After Fletcher heard her name called by presenter Charles Bronson and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">came to the stage</a> at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to accept her Oscar, she said: “Well, it looks like you all hated me so much that you’ve given me this award for it, and I’m loving every minute of it. And all I can say is, I’ve loved being hated by you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She then paid tribute to her parents: “And if you’ll excuse me [using sign language]: for my mother and my father, I want to say thank you for teaching me to have a dream. You are seeing my dream come true.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The second of four children, she was born on July 22, 1934, in Birmingham, Alabama, to an Episcopal minister, Rev. Robert C. Fletcher, and his wife, Estelle. They had both lost their hearing when they were children, he when he was struck by lightning, she to illness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">”If I fell down and hurt myself, I never cried,” Fletcher&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">told</a> The New York Times in 1975. “There was no one to hear me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She was extremely shy, and her parents sent her to an aunt in Texas, where she lived for parts of several years before attending Ramsay High School in Birmingham and then graduating from the University of North Carolina in 1957.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She took a trip to Los Angeles with friends and decided to stay, working as a receptionist while taking acting classes at night with the acclaimed teacher Jeff Corey. (Robert Blake was a fellow student.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After getting steady work on such television shows as Bat Masterson, Lawman, 77 Sunset Strip, Wagon Train and Perry Mason, the 5-foot-10 actress made her big-screen debut in the war film A Gathering of Eagles (1963), starring <a href=# id=auto-tag_rock-hudson data-tag=rock-hudson>Rock Hudson</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She had son John in 1961, and while pregnant with Andrew a year later, she decided to step away from the business. She was married to Jerry Bick, a literary agent who would produce such films as Altman’s The Long Goodbye (1973) and Thieves Like Us.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fletcher said she did not want to appear in Thieves Like Us because of her husband’s involvement, but Altman insisted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">To prepare for her role in Cuckoo’s Nest, Fletcher observed group therapy sessions at Oregon State Hospital in Salem, where the movie was shot. She spent 11 weeks at the facility during the making of the film.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In her New York Times interview, she described Mildred Ratched: “She was so out of touch with her feelings that she had no joy in her life and no concept of the fact that she could be wrong. She delivered her care of her insane patients in a killing manner, but she was convinced she was right.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Pauline Kael of The New Yorker called her performance “masterful,” and the film also won Oscars for best director, picture, actor and screenplay, a sweep matched only by It Happened One Night (1934) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fletcher never approached such acting greatness again.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The role of Linnea, the gospel-singing mother of two deaf children in Nashville (1975), was created with her in mind, but she and her husband had a falling-out with Altman, and Lily Tomlin <a href=# rel=noopener>got the part</a> (and an eventual supporting actress Oscar nom).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fletcher did appear in other movies including The Lady in Red (1979), Brainstorm (1983), Firestarter (1984), Invaders From Mars (1986), Flowers in the Attic (1987), Two Moon Junction (1988), Blue Steel (1990), The Player (1992) — back in good graces with Altman — Virtuosity (1995), High School High (1996), Mulholland Falls (1996), Cruel Intentions (1999) and A Map of the World (1999).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After she and Bick divorced, she made tabloid headlines by being romantically involved with the much-younger Morgan Mason. (The son of British actor James Mason, he went on to marry singer Belinda Carlisle.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to her sons, survivors include her sister, Roberta.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Forever known for playing Nurse Ratched, Fletcher <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">noted</a> in 2012 that she could no longer bear to watch herself in Cuckoo’s Nest. “I was really shocked in those scenes where I was actually so cruel,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK271KKqnmWWobK1r8eeqWaclZaxbrvNnmSfpJWseqTBwqSmqKtdo7K0wIxqaWxtYmeDd3%2BUaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-90-day-fianc%C3%A9-the-other-way-season-5-cast-mary-brandan-julio-kirsten-and-co-tue-11-ju.html><span>←</span><span> Meet 90 Day Fianc: The Other Way season 5 cast Mary, Brandan, Julio, Kirsten and co Tue 11 Ju</span></a>
