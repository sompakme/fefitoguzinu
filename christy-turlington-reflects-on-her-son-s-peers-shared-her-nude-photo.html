In fact, she told the outlet she’s not embarrassed about anything. “Regretting things is a waste of time,” Turlington said, making us love the fashion icon even more.</p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kate-winslet.jpg alt="Kate Winslet at the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards held at L.A.

Turlington hemorrhaged after Grace was born, and it was that terrifying experience that inspired her to found<a rel=nofollow href=#> Every Mother Counts</a>, a nonprofit centered around maternal health and making pregnancy and birth safe for women worldwide.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The organization has helped support more than 1.5 million women, families, and healthcare workers and invested more than $42 million in raising awareness and developing community-led solutions, per Harper’s Bazaar. Incredibly, Turlington doesn’t take a salary at Every Mother Counts even though it’s now her main job. “That doesn’t feel right,” she said, acknowledging how lucky she is to have the option to take a modeling gig to earn an income instead.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">We wouldn’t fault her if she did take a salary, but we’re incredibly moved to know that the millionaire really is putting the needs of moms (and moms-to-be) ahead of her own. Even as she juggles being a mom of two. Even as she juggles her transition into empty nester territory. And even as she deals with the boyhood bullsh*t a team of teens thought would be fun to thrust upon her family.</p><p><strong>These celebrity parents are sharing the struggle — and sweetness — of <a href=# rel=noopener>raising teenagers</a>.</strong><br><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/These-Celebrity-Parents-Make-Raising-Teenagers-Look-Easy-Or-at-Least-More-Bearable.jpg alt width=1024 height=768 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46aqa2hk6GytHuSaWdxcWNufKS00aKqrbFdqcKzuMinnq2nnmLAsLqMqZyeqqNiwKmt0Z5kp62UmnqxtM6tpmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carrie-preston-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Carrie Preston Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
