The former actress will also be taught evasive driving techniques as part of a general programme of security training.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77b5a2435d3d-prince-harry-driving-meghan-markle-christmas-lunch-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eBDuuC6_qhvJ data-wc=12><strong>Harry has been giving Meghan lessons in the grounds of Kensington Palace</strong></p><p id=eYzdKvnRV_LJ data-wc=96>While most members of the royal family are driven to their events and engagements, there are occasions, especially in their private time, when they take the wheel. Sources say that 36-year-old Meghan is keen to drive herself around in the future, and although most royal vehicles are automatic, being able to steer a manual during an emergency will be invaluable. Meghan is also reportedly in the process of applying for a British provisional licence, and she will have to pass her theory and practical test in the UK in order to drive on a permanent basis.</p><p id=el32lkNnbbAb><a class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about Harry and Meghan's royal wedding</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2441cea1ef79-prince-harry-meghan-markle-driving-car-christmas-lunch-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqtrd_VXKE4Ox data-wc=8><strong>Meghan is used to driving an automatic car</strong></p><p id=ez3VI6Q2IXkvX data-wc=64>When she was based in Canada for her acting job on , Meghan <a class=hm-link href=#>had a VIP contract with Audi</a> North America. She drove a £40,000 automatic Audi Q5 SUV but last September cancelled her contract a few months early – the big clue that she was preparing to move to London to be with Harry. Meghan did permanently relocate and their engagement was announced just two months later in November.</p><p id=ee5xaswD_KWIr><a class=hm-link href=#>Did you notice Meghan's fashion faux pas on her latest outing?</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=el8hZ_XNTaJdW data-wc=55>Like many car companies, Audi rents out cars to celebrities and VIPs on a preferential rate, in exchange for publicity. It's believed that Meghan acted as an unofficial 'ambassador' for the car brand for at least four years, and she is also expected to secure another Audi vehicle when she obtains her UK driving licence.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
