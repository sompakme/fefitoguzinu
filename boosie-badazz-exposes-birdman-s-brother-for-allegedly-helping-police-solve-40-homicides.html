This morning, Boosie took to Instagram where he shared a photo of the paperwork that reportedly states <a href=# rel>Williams helped police solve</a> over 40 homicides. The alleged paperwork states, “The New Orleans Cold Case Homicide division sent a letter to the USAD of the Eastern District Of Lousiana (“EDLA”) in which it outlined Williams’ cooperation in 40 cold case homicides.” It continues, “In an attempt to <a href=# rel>reduce his life sentence</a>, Williams closed 40 cold case homicides.”</p><p>However, if you look a bit deeper into the paperwork, it reads that Williams admitted to several of the murders. Still, Boosie had a field day with the information. “SO HE TOLD ON 40 DEAD PEOPLE,” Boosie wrote. “HELL NA HE TOLD ON THE WHOLE NEW ORLEANS WTF he look like #mastersplinter on this pic lol SAMMY THE BULL HAS BEEN OUT DONE BY A N***A FROM LOUISIANA,” he added. “THIS AINT BLACK HISTORY THIS RAT HISTORY WTF EVERYBODY SHOULD RUN WHEN U SEE THIS MAN," he added.</p><span><h2 id=h-boosie-badazz-s-beef-with-terrance-gangsta-williams>Boosie Badazz’s Beef With Terrance “Gangsta” Williams</h2></span><p>Issued flared up between Boosie Badazz & Terrence “Gangsta” Williams last month after the “Wipe Me Down” rapper’s interview with Vlad TV. As Boosie denounced <a href=# class=text-word rel>T.I.</a> for supposedly telling on his dead cousin to get out of a gun charge, Williams <a href=# rel>questioned Badazz’s stance on the matter</a>. “You also admitted you don’t mess with rats at all,” he said in a video shared to his YouTube page. “You and him have a good relationship, so have you cut T.I. off period? Or was that just a stunt on Vlad for the people to see that y’all still talk?"</p><p>Afterward, Terrance Williams shared a video of Boosie claiming to have filed a police report against the police, as well as a civil suit, over stolen jewelry. Afterward, Boosie went off on Williams in a series of homophobic tweets. “NEW ORLEANS SHOULD BAN THIS DUDE ‼️THIS IS THE WORST KINDA N***A‼️ HE A RAT , A FAMILY SNAKE , N A HOMOSEXUAL PLAYIN GANGSTER,” Boosie wrote. So far, Williams hasn’t responded to the paperwork but we’ll keep you posted if he does.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdman15gpFmmaino56ybq7AnZizsl2axbG70p6qZpqZp7Gurc2sZJuqn6m1pr6Mn6arZZGhuaazxJ2jsmWYmrmxtc2gZKmnnJ6wpnnSqKOvnaJigXF5x6ikopuZmbK0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bingo-gubelmann-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Bingo Gubelmann Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
