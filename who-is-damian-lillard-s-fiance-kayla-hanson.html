In addition to having KayLa Hanson join him in Portland, Lillard also relocated his mother and siblings to the city in an effort to get comfortable with staying on the team and winning a championship, via the <a href=#>Portland Tribune</a>. As a mother of three — especially one with two newborn twins! — Hanson highlights her motherly pride on Instagram. "And just like that we're a family of 5!! My team is the best team & I love it!," she captioned a family <a href=#>photo</a> with Lillard and their <a href=#>three kids</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As an NBA All-Star player, Lillard is used to hearing fans scream his name in the crowd. But no one praises his skill on the court more than his wife-to-be. "Yall are witnessing the hardest working man in the league," she captioned a <a href=#>photo</a> of Lillard on the court. "There's no slack, complain, or give up in him. He shows up 1st and leaves last. The true definition of playing your heart out," she added, before highlighting the family man role Lillard takes on when he is not playing <a href=#>basketball</a>. "All while keeping that same energy & mentality for his family. I know it's draining but you never show it," the salon owner said in the post's lengthy caption. Lillard and Hanson's social media PDA solidifies them as couple goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxpaIN3e9ahpmaho2KxornImqVmpJmhuaK%2Bw6xkn6GRo7CmecqasKWZXZ2ur7%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-accent-of-peppa-pig.html><span>←</span><span>What is the accent of Peppa Pig?</span></a>
