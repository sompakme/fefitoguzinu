Her casting was announced last April, with the Frida actor assuming Westworld star Thandie Newton's role after the British actor stepped away from the film for personal reasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now we have the first look at the film, with both Hayek and Tatum sharing a set photo on Instagram. In the pic, Hayek sits in a chic living room with her eyes closed, as Tatum's Mike Lane takes her hand and rests it on his bare abs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"All good things begin in Miami," Tatum captioned the pic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Magic Mike director Steven Sodebergh will helm the third, and presumed last, film of the hit franchise that has spawned reality shows and a Vegas attraction. It's set to premiere in theaters on February 10, 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Warner Bros. has yet to release official plot details, Tatum and his producing partner Reid Carolin revealed in a February <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/magic-mike-3-channing-tatum-soderbergh-1235169465/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a> interview, that the film will center on the female lead, and is in part inspired by Magic Mike Live.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s really about a woman stuck at a horrible strip show like a Chippendales and then realizing, 'What the hell am I doing here?'" Carolin told the outlet. "And then Magic Mike comes down from the ceiling. She gets to go down the rabbit hole and asks: What do I really want?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s going to have a really strong, almost stronger than Mike, character that’s female. We've never done a traditional love story, and this isn't a traditional love story," Tatum added, calling the film, "the Super Bowl of stripper movies."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tatum also discussed the film with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/movies/the-lost-city-sandra-bullock-channing-tatum-daniel-radcliffe.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Times</a>, describing the plot as a "reverse-role 'Pretty Woman' story." So Tatum as Julia Roberts and Hayek as Richard Gere? Sounds like a must-watch.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
