There ain't no mistake in the order.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jay made the revelation via his YouTube channel in a video titled: "I'VE BEEN HIDING MY SON FROM THE WORLD!!!" The first 9 minutes of the Vlog account for the explanation he felt he owed the World as a dutiful man if you will. By the 8th minute, he removes the dashboard cam, and films himself&nbsp;entering his home. Before the climactic unveiling, he gets on the phone, asking for an update on his son's condition - all the usual questions from the most unusual suspect.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The most touching moment occurs later in the video, as Jay attempts an adult conversation with the infant, only to realize he isn't necessarily up to the task himself. "To hell with that," he mutters. Later on, he tries to reason with the child. "Why are you crying?" he asked..&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No answer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The boys at YBN are becoming men right before our eyes, case in point.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdha4R2hZRmsJumXZa5rrXGoauyZZqWxm6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWqv4yspqdllKS7tXnWmqWnmV2gsqa8jLKmrmWRYsCmr9Geq2aZnq66sL7EZqWer6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-would-spiders-be-attracted-to-a-person.html><span>←</span><span>Why would spiders be attracted to a person?</span></a>
