Some of them might not have your good intentions at heart. Therefore, it is essential for one to learn how to hide date of birth on Facebook.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/acaae147c786cccb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing ways to insert PDF into Word</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One primary reason why you should avoid sharing your birth date on Facebook is that you only get the happiness that lasts for some seconds. The truth of the matter is, this is mostly considered as fake love. Most people who wish you these birthday wishes are usually unknown. The most genuine birthday wishes you can get are from those who remember your birth date even if you have not shared it on your online platform. Although the wishes may be from a few people, you are assured of genuine love and concern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e4fe1b1576dcb0dc.png><p class=align-left>Secondly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">avoid sharing your birthday</a> on this social media account because it only makes you immerse yourself deeper into technology. Once you start sharing such personal information, you tend to have no limits regarding what you can or cannot share. In addition to that, you tend to be always on your technological devices searching who commented on your age, why, and how it impacts you. In a nutshell, your life begins circulating in social media. Consequently, you lose your relationships because you would rather be online than physically hang out with your pals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the usefulness of the UNN portal!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The third reason you should not share your birthday information on Facebook is that it makes you emotionally vulnerable. This is because your stalkers, haters, and even supporters begin now comparing your posts with your age. Since every post you upload on any social media is prone to the public conscience, you cannot regulate what and how others respond to your posts and age. Therefore, some people may bully you or even attack your posts about your age. To avoid all these cyberbullying instances, do not share your birth date.</p><p class=align-left>For most individuals who want privacy, then it is essential to know how to hide birthday on Facebook.
