After making appearances all over the globe with a pit stop at this year's Met Gala, the superstar sat down for Wednesday's episode of Spotify's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Call Her Daddy</a>&nbsp;and said that while people like to bring up her husband Nick Jonas's former flames, she doesn't give them any thought at all. The Daily Mail notes that he's been linked to Olivia Culpo, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez, and was also rumored to be with Kate Hudson, Lily Collins, Kendall Jenner, and Delta Goodrem, but eventually tied the knot with Chopra in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't read my book backward.

Like, 'This is getting self-destructive at this point. I have to choose me," she said. And while she may have been attracted to Jonas's build and biceps at first, it was his heart that sealed the deal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As a girl, I've never had a guy tell me, 'I like your ambition.'
