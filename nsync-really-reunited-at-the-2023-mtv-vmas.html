The whole group was in attendance, including Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Noam Galai/Getty Images for MTV</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The award went to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;and her song "Anti-Hero."

"I had your dolls. Are you doing something? What's going to happen now? They're going to do something and I need to know what it is. You're pop personified so to receive this from you golden pop hands is really too much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Best Pop Video was just one of the nominations Swift had for the night, so she can rest easy for the remainder of the show and bask in the afterglow of getting to be within arm's reach of NSYNC knowing she's a winner on multiple fronts.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zaywp5tdp7K2usiopWZqYGeAbrnTr2SvpZGoeniFlXFwcW8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-starr-cause-of-death-age-wife-children-net-worth-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Starr Cause of death, Age, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Obituary</span></a>
