Aniston walked the red carpet with an updated version of the famously layered look at the Golden Globes, eschewing the longer, straighter look she's adopted in her post-Friends years. Even the color is similar to that which she wore at the time, down to the golden highlights and light brown lowlights.</p><p>Considering the hold that this style had on the public during the 1990s, it's tempting to predict (or even hope) that this hairstyle will be taking over the mid 2020s. The prediction isn't too far off considering other hair trends that have dominated the early years of the decade, from the mullet to the lob to the bob, all of which may culminate in a choppy cut like the Rachel, which seems to bring these styles together.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
