They fired over<a href=#> 100 people from their corporate HQ</a>, and they followed that up with roster cuts. Now, that last batch of WWE main roster releases are hitting the free agent market.</p><p>In September, WWE made the decision to release a number of talents, but they were not allowed to compete elsewhere. WWE’s non-compete clause kept them from getting right out there to compete.</p><p>WWE main roster talent must wait 90 days after they are released as part of their non-compete clause. NXT talent only have a 30 day non-compete clause attached to their deals, so some of those last releases are already competing. Now, the main roster talent will join them.</p><p>As of December 21st, the following performers will officially become free agents, offering them the opportunity to explore potential opportunities with any wrestling promotion. The list includes Mustafa Ali, Aliyah, Shelton Benjamin, Rick Boogs, Dana Brooke, Dabbo-Kato, Elias, Quincy Elliot, Yulissa Leon, Mace, Mansoor, Riddick Moss, Matt Riddle, Shanky, Top Dolla, and Dolph Ziggler.</p><p>We will have to see if Tony Khan scoops up any of those names for AEW. Dolph Ziggler and Mustafa Ali seem almost guaranteed to become All Elite eventually. Only time will tell what Top Dolla does, and the same goes for everyone else, from Elias to Matt Riddle.</p><p><a href=#>We already have clues that Riddle may return to MMA</a>. Also, Dana Brooke has already been cashing in with a premium content paywall site. Only time will tell what the future holds, but they will be free from those non-compete clauses soon.</p><p>What’s your take on these 2023 releases? Which one shocked you the most?
