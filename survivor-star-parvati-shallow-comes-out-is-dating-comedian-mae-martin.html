This is why we're cheering hard for Survivor star Parvati Shallow on hard-launching her relationship (and queerness!) with comedian Mae Martin (who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns).</p><p>"We‚Äôre here. We‚Äôre queer. Happy new year ‚ù§Ô∏èüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è," the caption to the post reads, featuring a photo booth image card of the duo kissing and looking absolutely blissed out in love.</p><p>Sigh. Call us a sentimental, romantic ol' fool if you must, but this is just the cutest, right?</p><p>I mean, look at these sweet snaps! Look at all of the love emanating off of both of them! A reminder that more love than you ever expected is always possible, even after heartbreak.</p><p>Fans of Shallow may remember that she was previously married to fellow Survivor contestant John Fincher, but the two divorced in August 2021. Martin is a Canadian comedian, actor, and screenwriter, best known for co-creating and starring in the acclaimed Netflix series, Feel Good. They also have a stand-up special, Sap, on the streamer, as well as a podcast called Handsome. (They also frequently perform comedy with another sweet and funny dreamboat, Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein, a.k.a. Roy Kent).</p><p>Martin also posted the images on Instagram alongside a video of the duo on a ferris wheel by the beach, featuring a playful wink from Shallow.</p><p>Adding to the couple's lore? A comment on Shallow's post from author Evan Ross Katz, who wrote, "A perfect pair. Honored to have played the tiniest role in this epic link-up. Love you both," prompting a tizzy of questions and demands for the story behind the matchmaking.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
