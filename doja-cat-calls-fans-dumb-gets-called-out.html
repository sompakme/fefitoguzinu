The singer is back in full force on her Twitter. Interestingly, barely any time has passed since she promised she'd be gone for a month. Doja's social media activity has become more cryptic as the <a href=# rel>release of her next album</a>, First Of All, approaches. The artist has been playfully discussing <a href=# rel>changing her stage name</a> and the title of her upcoming project. She has been confusing fans in the process. However, Doja has recently been trolling fans in an even more insulting way than usual. It all started when she shared a message stating, "I'm low-key handsome, it's crazy." In response, someone informed Doja that she would never be funny.</p><p>Of course, Doja Cat took this as an opportunity to troll further. The user that told her she would "never be funny" seemed to be advertising a debut single on their Twitter. So, Doja responded, "How's that debut single going?" This set off a long string of hilarious back and forth tweets. Doja and her fans traded insults, and much of it seemed to be in good fun. However, some took issue with a comment she made near the beginning of the troll fest. One person tweeted at Doja to say, "Everyone is mad because you are calling your fans dumb." Without wasting a moment, Doja responded, ".......are they not?"</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doja-gets-into-a-war-of-words>Doja Gets Into A War Of Words</h2></span><p>Doja Cat's statement about her fans' lack of intelligence has some people putting her in her place. As evidenced in the post about by The Neighborhood Talk, fans were quick to check her after the comment. "You was in dem chatrooms showing feet and we forgave you," one fan said. "Don't act dizzy now..." Doja Cat's previous internet chatroom activity sparked quite a bit of controversy when it came to light. Another fan read Doja, as well, but their comment was far more serious in tone. "Your behavior is not doing what you think it's doing," they said.</p><p>Doja Cat has always been pretty controversial on social media, but lately the situation has gone off the rails a bit. The singer has been sharing snippets and small pieces of information about her upcoming album. However, in the process, she has also managed to insult fans, downplay her previous work, and make herself extremely unlikeable. The artist came online to announce the name of her new album, but she had some choice words for her two most recent albums. Doja stated that both Hot Pink and Planet HER were simply "cash grabs," <a href=# rel>implying they were not her best work</a>. She expressed that she could now disappear to an island and enjoy nature since she made her money. In the meantime, she said, her fans can mourn the loss of what she considers average pop music. Interestingly enough, she <a href=# rel>won the BMI Songwriter of the Year award</a> after these comments. What do you think of Doja's latest comment?
