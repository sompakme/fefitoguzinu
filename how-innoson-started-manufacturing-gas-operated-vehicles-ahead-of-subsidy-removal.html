That was my own thinking before I started to develop CNG vehicles. I knew it was the way forward. I knew that the government must eventually remove fuel subsidy. So, I started planning by buying the equipment. That was why I was able to produce so many units immediately the fuel subsidy was removed by the government.<p class=align-left>He said that in cities like Benin, a remarkable 80% of the vehicles on the road run on CNG because of the positive experience.

Before the cost will come down, there is a need for an investment which requires government support. With such investment, the cost of conversion to CNG can be reduced to N300,000.<p class=align-left>He added that there are also certain components that are supposed to be readily available or produced in Nigeria. If that happens, the conversion will not cost more than N300,000 and not N800,000 which it presently goes for.</p><h2>Subsidy removal: Innoson rolls out gas-powered trucks, buses, and cars</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <a href=#><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported</a> that Innoson Motors, the indigenous automobile manufacturing company in Nigeria, unveiled its latest innovation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/171dc9fd389afb67.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Fuel expensive”: Tinubu’s government moves to convert 10 million petrol vehicles to run on gas</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The automobile company launched the Innoson LNG/CNG Gas Trucks, buses, and cars, at its production facility located in Nnewi, <a href=#>Anambra State</a>.</p><p class=align-left>This milestone was celebrated on Tuesday, April 20, 2023, under the auspices of Otunba Francis Meshioye, the President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).</p><p class=align-left>This development aligns with the impending removal of petrol subsidies by the Nigerian government, scheduled for June this year.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtdmrCwus6msGihnpnCtMDRsmZqbWVnfniCjKGmsGWZo7uwv86nZJuno6h6sbjAp6WenF2irq%2FBxZqara2imnqordJmpqmdopbBprCMr5yhoZOhsrR50q6ZrKGUrnqzscyorZqkXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryson-tiller.html><span>←</span><span>Bryson Tiller</span></a>
