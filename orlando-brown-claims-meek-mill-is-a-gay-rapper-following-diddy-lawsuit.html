When asked whether he thinks Ross would knowingly sign a gay rapper, Brown reiterated: "Rick Ross knows he's gay is what I said. He paid me $2,000 to say that right? You only paid me $2,000." From there, Adam22 denied paying Brown to claim Meek Mill is gay. Elsewhere in the interview, Brown voiced his support for Diddy. “Everybody knows I got respect for Diddy,” Brown told the host. “I love Diddy. Everybody tried to come at Diddy. Why I'm gonna make it harder for my man? Yo, I love my man [Diddy].”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy-amp-meek-mill-attend-revolt-launch-party>Diddy & Meek Mill Attend Revolt Launch Party</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 21: (L-R) Meek Mill and Diddy attend the Revolt launch party at Slate on October 21, 2013 in New York City.

Fans incessantly trolled him about the rumors on social media in the following days. Meek Mill asked fans to stop questioning his sexuality on Twitter shortly afterward. "Stop asking me if I’m straight I’m just gonna play it raw how the world is … I’m blessed I’m okay but I ain’t hearing nothing good looking!" he wrote at the time. As for the house raids, Homeland Security agents descended upon Diddy's properties, last week, although no arrests were made.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-orlando-brown-speaks-on-meek-mill-amp-diddy>Orlando Brown Speaks On Meek Mill & Diddy</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
