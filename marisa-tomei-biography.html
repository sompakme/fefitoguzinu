After seeing <i>A Chorus Line</i> on stage as a pre-teen Marisa set her sights on a career in entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePsH3LDGR-B data-wc=41>"I was 12 and I came away with a reverence for the magic," she says. Dropping out of Boston University to enroll at NYU, she quit academia completely when she landed a role on long-running soap opera <i>As The World Turns.</i>&nbsp;</p><h2>Her film career</h2><p id=euEzOXMfM8i data-wc=48>She continued to go to every audition she could, and eventually landed a one-liner in 1984's <i>The Flamingo Kid</i>, where she made her big screen debut exclaiming: "You're so drunk!". In 1987, she moved to LA for a prime-time gig on <i>The Cosby Show</i> spinoff <i>A Different World.</i>&nbsp;</p><p id=e7EnWKolPp9 data-wc=63>She left after just one year on the show, however, reemerging in 1991 in her first serious film role as Sylvester Stallone's daughter in <i>Oscar.</i>Marissa had done small roles in half a dozen films including an uncredited turn in 1985's cult flick <i>Toxic Avenger</i> when she won the Academy Award for her scene-stealing portrayal as gum-chewing Mona Lisa Vito in <i>My Cousin Vinny.</i>&nbsp;</p><p id=es0V13DnLdk data-wc=55>Her victory must have been especially sweet, coming as it did over an impressive list of film vets including <a aria-label="Biography of Vanessa Redgrave" class=hm-link href=#>Vanessa Redgrave</a>, Joan Plowright, Judy Davis and Miranda Richardson.Yet despite her critically acclaimed performance as silent film star Mabel Normand alongside <a aria-label="Biography of Robert Downey Jr" class=hm-link href=#>Robert Downey Jr</a> in <i>Chaplin</i>, the Oscar triumph seemed to lead her into cinematic obscurity.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTvGrPHTb3U data-wc=17>An effect so dramatic the <i>New York Times</i> once labelled her Academy Award a "cement life preserver".&nbsp;</p><p id=e7o2PV1W90U data-wc=51>"Sometimes I feel as if I'm supposed to be defending myself," she said in 1994. "In some ways, I do think the Oscar was premature, but I also feel I have the potential to be a great actress. For me now, it's a matter of fulfilling the potential I have inside."&nbsp;</p><p id=euv5lhpa4Ea data-wc=58>Riding out the ups and downs of her career, Marisa continued to work in Hollywood, following her first Oscar with charming performances in <i>Only You</i> and <i>Untamed Heart,</i> while also pursuing a stage career. Her film efforts caught critics' attention once again in the late Nineties with standout roles in <i>Unhook The Stars</i> and <i>Slums Of Beverly Hills.</i>&nbsp;</p><p id=eAKFNCmjI4E data-wc=47>Having worked her way back, Marisa was upbeat about her second round of success. "I don't call it a comeback," she said in 2002. "I feel a shift in the way people are taking me more seriously... I guess people didn't know I was a real actress."</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9wcGZkuqK%2ByKyYZqyforKqew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marie-osmond-husband-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Marie Osmond Husband Net Worth 2024</span></a>
