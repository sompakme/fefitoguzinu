He brushed both songs aside, telling the Washington Post, "Some of the worst songs I ever sang were big hits."</p><p dir=ltr>It's not unusual for musicians to <a href=#>hate their most famous songs</a>. However, Mathis <a href=#>disliked "Misty" and "The Twelfth of Never</a>" not because he was tired of satisfying fan requests, but because he was young and wanted to make a splash on the music scene with music that had more energy.</p><p dir=ltr>"I didn't like ['The Twelfth of Never'] because it was all so repetitious, and nothing seemed to happen," Mathis told Pop Chronicles (via <a href=#>SongFacts</a>). He continued, "I wanted to do something, you know, rah-rah-rah, something earth-shattering."</p><p dir=ltr>And Mathis had <a href=#>no intention of recording "Misty."</a>&nbsp;It was originally an instrumental tune by jazz pianist Erroll Garner, who pestered Mathis into recording vocals on the track. Mathis eventually caved and hoped to drag it out by saying he would sing if Garner wrote the lyrics. Much to Mathis' dismay, Garner produced those lyrics and Mathis was left with no choice but to record the song. "I was just praying that he would forget about it," Mathis admitted, even if it did land him one of his three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>But when the writer from the&nbsp;<a href=#>Washington Post</a> asked which song he would most want to be remembered for, Mathis perked up and replied that it would be "When I Fall in Love," his 1952 classic written by Victor Young and Edward Heyman. "Not only is it a pretty song, the lyrics to me are especially wonderful." He added: "It's me. That song is me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fj2ttcm9fqbWmedGemKynnmK3sLTNp7BmpZGptaq%2FjKGYrZ2UYsG4u4yonWagmah6rrvSrWSfmZ2kwrR50qiloKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-camilla-says-kate-middleton-thrilled-by-support-after-cancer-reveal.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Camilla Says Kate Middleton &amp;quot;Thrilled&amp;quot; by Support After Cancer Reveal</span></a>
