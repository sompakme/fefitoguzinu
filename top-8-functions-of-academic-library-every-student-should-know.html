And there is no wonder since it possesses various collections of books for any university’s faculty or department aimed to help both students and professors carrying out researches, assignments, and even some leisure activities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ff1a2e13275317f3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A handy guide to the UI portal for all University of Ibadan students!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, some of you may not fully understand the whole purposes of it and want to discuss the major functions of the academic library in correspondence to the public or local ones. Thus, the main difference between them lies in the books collection presented in the libraries.</p><p class=align-left>Hence, the first and the main function of the <a href=#>academic library</a> among all others is to support all the students, professors, and other academic staff in their educational pursuit. That is why it offers not only local nonfiction, historical, and archival volumes but also any selection of nonfiction, classics, modern fiction, and scientific literature as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ff1a2e13275317f3.jpeg><h2>What are the other functions of the academic library in teaching and learning</h2><p class=align-left>Having already stated the difference between the types of knowledge houses, now let’s highlight all the functions and services of the academic library.</p><h3>The functions of the academic library in teaching and learning are the following:</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/05e5eeb6cec6d205.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What are people management skills?

All the hard work of maintaining and supporting the whole library alongside the students and educational stuff depends on them. They are to process acquisitions, support electronic resources, as well as assist students and professors while studying and doing research work by looking for the information needed in the books and online resources also.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ab95935d38048e76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top rated procurement officer in Nigeria: role, duties, courses, jobs and salaries!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, not every person can become a librarian. It is usually well-educated men or women with a double PhDs even, who specializes in specific types of books. And it is rather hard and demanding work, so they often visit and study various courses, instructions and sources to do all the best at work.</p><p class=align-left>So, now you see how important the academic libraries are to all the students, researchers, scientists, and teachers. And how many efforts the librarians make every day to maintain all the functions and services of the library, so people can easily achieve new pieces of knowledge without obstacles.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>List of Top 20 Best Nigerian Universities in 2021</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng </a>posted an article of the list of top <a href=#>20 best Nigerian universities</a>.
