The business mogul was spotted visiting Chalamet at his LA home, showcasing that they're still very much an item. It seems like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">things only continue to heat up</a> for the pair, as evidenced by a new shot of Kylie. In the photo, the mother of two is seen adjusting her shades at Prada's Milan Fashion Week show. She also inadvertently revealed her iPhone background. It appears that every time Kylie stares down at her phone, she's met with an image of none other than her new boyfriend Timothee, planting a kiss on her cheek.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kylie-jenner-inadvertently-shows-off-romantic-phone-background>Kylie Jenner Inadvertently Shows Off Romantic Phone Background</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jenner's background only further confirms the spark between the two of them, which Chalamet also recently showcased during a chat with TMZ. They caught up with the NYC native earlier this week, and despite his attempts to dodge questions about the reality star, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">managed to capture a smile</a>. Though most fans are in total support of the pair, some critics just can't get past their differences.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some believe that the two just simply aren't a match, with some even feeling as though they've been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">disrespectful to Kylie's ex</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>. With that being said, it doesn't look like the couple will be letting haters get between them any time soon. What do you think of Timothee Chalamet being Kylie Jenner's phone background?
