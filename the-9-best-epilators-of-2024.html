But before you leap head-first into the world of epilators, we spoke to dermatologists and experts about what you should know—like exactly what epilators are, how they work, how long the results last, and the details to look for. Not to mention, the experts we spoke to even recommended a few of their favorite epilators to make your search easier.&nbsp;Smooth skin ahead!</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-is-an-epilator><span>What Is an Epilator?</span></h2><p>“An epilator is a handheld powered device that mechanically removes the hair,” explains <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/snehal-amin-md-faad referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Dr. Snehal Amin</u></a>, the co-founder and surgical director of MDCS Dermatology. “Unlike shaving, which cuts the hair off at the skin’s surface, epilators remove hair deeper—at the level of the follicle or roots.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-do-you-use-an-epilator><span>How Do You Use an Epilator?</span></h2><p>Just like using any new hair removal device, using an epilator comes with a slight learning curve. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.unionderm.com/doctors/dr-kenneth-howe/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Kenneth Howe</a>, a Dermatologist at UnionDerm in New York City, explains: “You use an epilator by moving it slowly along the skin surface in the direction of hair growth. You should hold the device at a 90-degree angle to the skin."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-do-epilators-work><span>How Do Epilators Work?</span></h2><p>While epilators often get confused with laser hair removal devices, the two hair removal tools work differently. “Epilators work by grasping hairs and pulling them out by the root. Basically, the same way <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-tweezers/>tweezers</a> do—only you’re tweezing multiple hairs at the same time,” says Dr. Howe. “Some hair shafts may twist and/or shatter when they’re yanked by the epilator. Those damaged hairs may result in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22999432/how-to-get-rid-of-ingrown-hair/>ingrown hairs</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Howe explains that laser hair removal devices, on the other hand, “work by targeting the pigmented hair bulb.” He says that it's the “heat injury” from the device that keeps the hair from growing. However, he says that the “actual physical hair shaft remains in place.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-do-epilators-hurt><span>Do Epilators Hurt?</span></h2><p>Dr. Howe is quick to note that using epilators does hurt. “[Using an epilator] is difficult for a lot of people,” he says. “I think of it as a waxing treatment in super slow-motion.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-epilators><span>The Best Epilators</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Finishing Touch Flawless Women's Painless Hair Remover" data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/flawless-instant-painless-facial-hair-remover-xlsImpprod16641047?sku=2513786&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1211557325212&CAAGID=122094612927&CAWELAID=330000200001219003&CATARGETID=330000200002744335&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcRircdPGDBMSRnpAMHG5VSofmiagFrVMjAYjyDTYpZ2En-D7AomwA8aAkYsEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2513786&cmpid=PS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1211557325212&CAAGID=122094612927&CAWELAID=330000200001219003&CATARGETID=330000200002744335&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcRircdPGDBMSRnpAMHG5VSofmiagFrVMjAYjyDTYpZ2En-D7AomwA8aAkYsEALw_wcB&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fflawless-instant-painless-facial-hair-remover-xlsImpprod16641047%3Fsku%3D2513786%26cmpid%3DPS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads%26cagpspn%3Dpla%26CATCI%3Dpla-1211557325212%26CAAGID%3D122094612927%26CAWELAID%3D330000200001219003%26CATARGETID%3D330000200002744335%26CADevice%3Dc%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcRircdPGDBMSRnpAMHG5VSofmiagFrVMjAYjyDTYpZ2En-D7AomwA8aAkYsEALw_wcB&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bjKZVsp2RuNrBz9af6sAf-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Epilator for the Face</span></p></a><p>Finishing Touch Flawless Women's Painless Hair Remover</p><p>This portable little $20 epilator has both Dr. Howe’s and Dr. Amin’s stamps of approval. “Facial hair is finer, and can accordingly be removed with less trauma and less irritation,” says Dr. Howe.

It has completely cut down my leg shaving to almost once a month compared to what seemed like a twice a week ordeal. I did a test trial on it when I first got it, I did one leg with the epilator and regular shaving with the other at different intervals. I used the epilator one week on the left leg, then the following week I shaved my other leg. The left leg was still smooth and hardly had any hair growth during the 3rd week while the leg that I used a regular razor on seemed to have so much more growth in comparison. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to cut down on their shaving." — Amazon&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Conair True Glow Total Body Epilator " data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/true-glow-total-body-epilator-pimprod2007228?sku=2545854&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1211557325212&CAAGID=122094612927&CAWELAID=330000200001884401&CATARGETID=330000200002744335&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcTEnnPdhZLVc8kJHe77Jg78erQj-IdngUUOu2x_jQU5QEHj3SApMM4aAutDEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2545854&cmpid=PS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1211557325212&CAAGID=122094612927&CAWELAID=330000200001884401&CATARGETID=330000200002744335&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcTEnnPdhZLVc8kJHe77Jg78erQj-IdngUUOu2x_jQU5QEHj3SApMM4aAutDEALw_wcB&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Ftrue-glow-total-body-epilator-pimprod2007228%3Fsku%3D2545854%26cmpid%3DPS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads%26cagpspn%3Dpla%26CATCI%3Dpla-1211557325212%26CAAGID%3D122094612927%26CAWELAID%3D330000200001884401%26CATARGETID%3D330000200002744335%26CADevice%3Dc%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcTEnnPdhZLVc8kJHe77Jg78erQj-IdngUUOu2x_jQU5QEHj3SApMM4aAutDEALw_wcB&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HvGEi5CqDamyrGLHYhrcpe-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Epilator for Body</span></p></a><p>Conair True Glow Total Body Epilator</p><p>If you plan on using your epilator for legs, arms, and everything in between, check out this option from Conair. It has 40 ultra-fine tweezers to catch every little hair. While directions will differ per product, it’s advised that this epilator be used on dry skin and, most importantly, in the direction of hair growth. “It’s important to move the device slowly, in the direction of hair growth, otherwise you may break the hair rather than pull it out from the root,” says Dr. Amin. He recommends holding the skin tight and positioning the device at a 90-degree angle. Pressure should be gentle—don’t push down too hard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Costs less than $50; Dermatologist-Approved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can only be used on dry skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Reviews: </strong>"I decided to wait a few months before posting my review. This is my first epilator and I like the product. Yes, it is painful-ish at first and there is no way to get decent results by rushing and moving faster. You'll just end up with a bunch of broken off stubby hairs!! Epilating takes longer than shaving/waxing because you have to wait for the device to pull all the hair out of each section, but it is worth the wait. I complete maintenance every other week because I'll start to feel new hair growing and maintenance sessions are less painful. Fewer and fewer thicker hairs come back each time." — Ulta</p><a href=# data-model-name="Panasonic Cordless Shaver Epilator" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Cordless-Epilator-Attachments-Underarms/dp/B07RBNJFNP/ref=asc_df_B07RBNJFNP/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=343161325176&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14273381657434124343&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060351&hvtargid=pla-759386861753&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=71700325080&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=343161325176&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14273381657434124343&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060351&hvtargid=pla-759386861753" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FPanasonic-Cordless-Epilator-Attachments-Underarms%2Fdp%2FB07RBNJFNP%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B07RBNJFNP%2F%3FlinkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D343161325176%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D14273381657434124343%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D9060351%26hvtargid%3Dpla-759386861753%26psc%3D1%26ref%3D%26adgrpid%3D71700325080%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZqMYDokYuhUJmy2KaDCXf-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Epilator for the Bikini Line</span></p></a><p>Panasonic Cordless Shaver Epilator</p><p>While a <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a26951140/prepare-brazilian-bikini-wax-less-pain/>bikini wax</a> is efficient, it requires about two weeks of growth for optimal results.
