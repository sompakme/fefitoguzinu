(She is now Queen Camilla; in May 2019, she was the Duchess of Cornwall.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AdZuS6RzTKVbeZedDeE6eQ-1920-80.jpg><p>If you’ll remember, Archie’s parents, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle, took a different approach from <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-charles/>Prince Charles</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess Diana</a> and, later, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Kate's titles before they became the Prince and Princess of Wales in 2022), when it came to introducing Archie to the world. There was no Lindo Wing photocall to introduce the new baby to the press and, ergo, the public—instead, Harry, Meghan, and Archie took part in a photocall two days after his birth at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/windsor-castle/>Windsor Castle</a>. (Not that it’s apples to apples—and not that this is the so-called “right” way to do it—but the children of William and Kate were typically presented on the steps of the Lindo Wing within hours after their respective births.) Of this decision, Harry and Meghan said on their eponymous Netflix docuseries that “There was already the pressure of the picture with Archie on the steps,” Meghan said. “‘Are they going to do that, or are they not?’ But I had been really worried going into that labor, because I am older [she was 37 when Archie was born], and I didn’t know if I would have to have a C-section.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CiBqpkY3wkd9Azb6zHPUcR-1920-80.jpg><p>Meghan added “I had a very longstanding relationship with my doctor, and that is who I trusted with my pregnancy. And they said, ‘Right, but she is at Portland Hospital, and the steps are at this hospital [the Lindo Wing].’ And I said, ‘Okay, we could do a photocall in front of Portland Hospital.’ They said ‘It is impossible. We couldn’t barricade the streets off, and it would create a threat for the emergency room entrance because that is where you would have to do this picture.’” Instead, the alternative plan for the May 8 photocall at Windsor Castle was what was decided on.</p><p>“I remember showing Camilla in, I think, Munich the first pictures of Archie that was taken by the press,” Edwards said. “I showed her on my phone, and that was the first time she saw him. It was difficult times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWq5eAfd9v4KX5pwkXCcph-1920-80.jpg><p>Harry has not had the warmest of relations with his stepmother over the years—perhaps not difficult to imagine, considering Camilla’s role in the breakdown of Harry’s parents’ marriage. (Which, to be fair, probably would have ended eventually even without Camilla, but we’ll never know.) In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Harry claimed Camilla played “the long game,” with a campaign aimed specifically at his father, Charles, and, therefore, “the crown.”</p><p>“I had complex feelings about gaining a stepparent who, I believed, had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar,” Harry wrote, also referring to her as “dangerous.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do, because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago.”</p><p>It’s tension between father and son that continues to the present month, when Harry was in the U.K. celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/invictus-games/>Invictus Games</a> and couldn’t see his father because the King’s schedule was reportedly too full. According to The Sunday Times’ royal editor Roya Nikkah—who was speaking on the podcast <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://shows.acast.com/the-royals referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>“The Royals with Roya and Kate”</u></a>—Harry was offered by the King to stay at a royal residence, but he turned the offer down. Nikkhah said she “found out that actually, Harry had asked if he could stay [at a royal residence], and Charles had said ‘Yes, come and stay, son. You come and stay in a royal residence, you are near where I am, so it’s going to be much easier for me to see you, given what’s going on with my diary and your diary.’ And that turned everything on its head, because the narrative from Harry that ‘I wanted to see my father, but he is too busy to see me’—actually, the reality was Charles said ‘Yes, please do come and stay in a royal gaff, and that would make it much easier to see each other.’”</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-king-charles-possibility-of-meeting-if-harry-had-stayed-royal-residence/><u>Marie Claire</u></a> reported earlier this month that Harry declined the offer because of security concerns.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MJLwSamFCnTvqMuDhxu5nV-1920-80.jpg><p>As for Camilla, when it comes to Harry, Lady Lansdowne—a close confidante of the Queen’s—told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj4_8f-pbCGAxWXiVAGHXPjBgoYABAAGgJkZw&ase=2&gclid=CjwKCAjwgdayBhBQEiwAXhMxtoMaSwl1CuySvyMNFUONdtIRgHx_7d5rmC_-Gk72SXkg3ii25AtDOhoCdXYQAvD_BwE&sig=AOD64_02r6A5qsE5efrFCJzp5oe-a82UZw&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwizlsH-pbCGAxVPTEEAHXgiBf4Q0Qx6BAgPEAE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Sunday Times</u></a> “Of course it bothers her, of course it hurts,” she said. “But she doesn’t let it get to her.
