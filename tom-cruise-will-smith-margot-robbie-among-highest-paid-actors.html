If there's one group of people not feeling the pinch of the rising cost of living, it's movie stars.
Hollywood's brightest are commanding enormous, eye-popping pay cheques to flash their pearly veneers at the camera, the kind of money that would make even lottery winners jealous.
Industry bible Variety has released a list of what the top actors have earned for their recent or upcoming films and, unsurprisingly, Tom Cruise tops the list."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This means even if a film lost money after production and marketing costs, Cruise would still get paid.</p><p>In the case of Top Gun: Maverick – the box office is currently on US$1.24 billion ($2b) and still going – Cruise will collect big. His deal is said to also include a back-end percentage of digital rentals, DVDs and streaming revenue.</p><p>He is also slated to take home upfront salaries of between US$12m-US$14m for the two upcoming Mission Impossible sequels. He likely has a similar "first-dollar gross" deal for those two films.</p><p>Director Christopher Nolan is said to be another figure who commands a "first-dollar gross" deal.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The actor sitting in second position on the top salary charts is Will Smith, who was paid US$35m ($56m) for his role in Apple TV+ movie Emancipation, which was greenlit and filmed before he assaulted Chris Rock onstage during the live Oscars broadcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/AOK8QawB0AA2inAEhfxYkV7LpIM=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LKHHJ7Q2X3GNX4QH7YOLVSQ26Y.jpg"><p>Apple seems to be very generous with its stars as it seeks to establish itself as a power player in the industry. It also shelled out US$30m ($48m) for Leonardo DiCaprio's involvement in Killers Of The Flower Moon, a Martin Scorsese crime drama that will also star Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons and Lily Gladstone.</p><p>Brad Pitt was, similarly, the beneficiary of Apple's largesse, taking home a US$30m ($48m) pay cheque for his role in an upcoming, still untitled, drama set in the world of Formula 1. Top Gun: Maverick director Joe Kosinski will helm the project while UK F1 driver Lewis Hamilton is one of the producers. Pitt's production company Plan B is also on board.</p><p>Streaming companies often pay well upfront to compensate for the lack of back-end profits that could have been generated from a cinema release.</p><p>In the same vein, Chris Hemsworth was paid US$20m ($32m) for the sequel to Netflix action flick Extraction, which became the streaming platform's most watched original movie.</p><p>Netflix also paid up to lure Millie Bobby Brown back for the sequel to Enola Holmes. She was paid US$10 ($16m) for the next instalment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

highest ranked woman on the list doesn't come into play until the equal 16th spot, and it goes to Margot Robbie who is being paid US$12.5m ($20m) for her role in Barbie.</p><p>Her co-star Ryan Gosling is being paid the same amount but Robbie may be commanding more separately as she is also a producer on the Greta Gerwig film through her company LuckyChap Entertainment.</p><p>Elsewhere, donning a comic book costume continues to be lucrative with Dwayne Johnson being paid US$22.5m ($36m) for DC movie Black Adam while Tom Hardy will rake in US$20m ($32m) for Venom 3.</p><p>Jason Momoa's payday for the next Aquaman flick will be US$15m ($24m) while Joaquin Phoenix will command US$20m ($32m) for the Joker sequel.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>According to Variety, Phoenix made a comparatively paltry US$4.5m ($7.2m) on the first Joker movie but the film then went on to take in over US$1b ($1.6b) at the box office and also won a swag of awards including an Oscar for Phoenix.</p><img

on the TV side, the salaries are lower despite producing more hours of entertainment.</p><p>While some top-tier talent can still ask for US$1m ($1.6m) per episode, there are fewer episodes in TV in the current era, compared to when the stars of Friends were being paid US$1m per episode for seasons that ran for 24 episodes a year.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Streaming shows typically number between six and 10 episodes per season while broadcast shows have a longer run.</p><p>Only two multi-Oscar winners are commanding above US$1m per episode with Mahershala Ali and Kevin Costner both taking home US$1.3m ($2m) per episode for their shows The Pilot and Yellowstone, respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

those being paid US$1m per episode include Elisabeth Moss for Shining Girls, Michael Keaton for Dopesick, Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren for 1923, Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd for The Shrink Next Door, Jason Sudeikis for Ted Lasso, Sylvester Stallone for Tulsa King, an upcoming series from Taylor Sheridan and Terrence Winter.</p><p>TV salaries seem to be better spread between men and women, at least
