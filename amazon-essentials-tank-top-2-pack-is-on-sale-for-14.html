Of course, like many who second-hand shop, there’s a piece in my closet that I bought under the logic of, “if I don’t buy this now, someone else will,” that I then never wore, and there are a few pandemic micro-trends that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The White Lotus’ Portia</a> would happily accept as hand-me-downs.

Sure. Would I ever in a million years do it again? Absolutely not. In a blind test of my $40 pick and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hanes tank</a> — which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>even celebrities favor</a> — I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. As I’ve learned, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>a tank top</a> is a tank top, no matter the price. So my advice: Don’t make the same mistake I did. Instead, stock up on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this Amazon Essentials basic</a> that <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">shoppers are calling</a> “the perfect tank” while it’s on sale for just $7 apiece.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $14 (Originally $15); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essential’s slim-fit tank top two-pack</a>, which is loved by over 32,000 shoppers, is now $14. This is available in 37 different color combinations, including classics like white and black, as well as bolder colors and patterns, including stripes, hot pink, and lime green. These ribbed tanks are made of a cotton, modal, and spandex blend that gives them ample softness with a decent amount of stretch. “The material is soft and stretches to your shape,” wrote <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one shopper</a>, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">another adding</a> that despite the flexibility of the top, these, “maintain their shape and can be worn repeatedly between washes without…stretch[ing] out,” or becoming “see-through.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others were impressed with the comfort and quality, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one customer</a> writing, “the first thing I noticed is how soft the fabric is!” Some additional shoppers were pleasantly surprised to learn that, despite the low price point, these tanks are decently thick. “These aren’t super sheer or cheaply made. They are good quality and last,” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wrote one</a>, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">another adding</a>, “the fabric is nice and thick and feels substantial.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every closet needs a basic tank, whether as an undershirt, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perfect jean pairing</a>, or for around-the-house lounging, so <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">grab this set</a> while it’s just $7 apiece at Amazon.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKaYs6eeYrK0v8Snq6KZnKh6ta3NpGStp6Biwbi7jKmYnKNdqK6tsYxwaG5qYmiE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glee-star-heather-morris-remembers-naya-rivera-in-emotional-tribute.html><span>←</span><span>'Glee' Star Heather Morris Remembers Naya Rivera in Emotional Tribute</span></a>
