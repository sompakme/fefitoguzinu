Meet The Split stars' real-life other halves…</p><h2>Nicola Walker</h2><p id=eFB8Qn7jJgSq>Nicola Walker, who plays Hannah Stern, is married to actor Barnaby Kay in real life. The couple married after almost 20 years together to provide a sense of security for their son Harry, who was born in 2006. However, it sounds like Nicola hadn't always dreamed of a big white wedding, and their ceremony was more of an intimate affair. She told Radio Times: "I don’t know if I should tell the truth – it doesn't sound very romantic. I find the whole ceremony of marriage a bit like going to work. Putting on a lovely dress and makeup, learning lines, someone doing your hair … I can see that would be really appealing if you don't do it for a living. It's a public performance. Though we had a really lovely day because we didn’t do that. We had a tiny family thing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZmtoYmV9dH2PcW1pcGBkwamxjKynpaGkYrCiv9NmqZ6ZnGK5qrLEZp%2Buq5KWu6W%2FjLCgr52jYr2ivtOnnKurXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-granary-lodge-bed-breakfast-hotel-review-scottish-highlands.html><span>←</span><span>The Granary Lodge Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast Hotel Review, Scottish Highlands</span></a>
