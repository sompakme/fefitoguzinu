But how do you achieve it? It's easier than you think: The key to getting healthy, dewy skin—which appears fresh and luminous but not greasy—is to hydrate it well.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Suchismita Paul, MD</a> says dewy skin appears when the skin exudes a radiant glow with an even tone. "The skin is often its healthiest when it is most hydrated," she adds. Furthermore, board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jeannette Graf, MD</a> adds that dewy skin isn't a medical term and is the opposite of dull skin. "It usually has a plumpness and lit-from-within look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to double board-certified plastic surgeon and cosmetic dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Karan Lal, DO</a>, truly dewy skin should look like you just had your makeup done but without wearing any makeup. "All skin types can achieve the dewy look, and people with oilier skin often tend to be naturally dewier than those with dry skin," he says. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dry skin</a> can have a hard time getting their skin to the point of optimal dewiness because the skin sucks up water instead of allowing it to sit on top."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-home-skincare-for-dewy-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At-Home Skincare for Dewy Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The key to dewy skin is using the right skincare ingredients and following a consistent routine. Applying a product once or twice without repetition in your skincare regimen may not do enough to induce a dewy effect. At home, it's important to incorporate the following steps into your regular skincare routine.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cleanse Thoroughly</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Washing the skin at least once daily, if not twice, helps lift away dirt, oil, dead skin cells, and product buildup, which can hinder the skin's dew factor. When too much debris sits on the skin's surface, it's unable to reflect light properly, which can leave the skin looking flat. Washing with a simple, hydrating cleanser for about one minute should do the job.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Exfoliate Regularly</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;Regularly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>exfoliating</a> the skin is a must for achieving glowy skin since exfoliating helps lift away dead, dull skin cells and keep dryness at bay, allowing light to reflect off the skin properly. Board-certified cosmetic and medical dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Claire Wolinsky, MD,</a> recommends exfoliating the skin at least twice weekly unless it is oily or acne-prone. "In those cases, sometimes daily use of an alpha hydroxy acid or beta hydroxy acid exfoliants can be used."</p><p>Regularly exfoliating the skin allows other skincare products to penetrate better, Dr. Lal adds. Just don't go overboard, or you may inadvertently disrupt the skin barrier and cause it to produce more oil.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While physical and chemical exfoliators, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dr. Loretta Resurfacing Enzyme Polish</a> ($60) and<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow> Lion Pose Unspotted</a> ($79), work wonders for freshening up the skin so it's dewy and glowy, at-home chemical peels like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>NudeStix Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel</a> ($35) are beneficial, too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Incorporate Serums</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While hydrating ingredients are great for creating dewy skin, don't discount the power of retinol and retinoids. Dr. Graf says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol</a> increases cell turnover, leaving it glowing and fresh. "Peptides are another ingredient since they can also help create dewy skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vitamin C also boosts cell turnover, while brightening discoloration and evening out skin tone so it's more uniform and healthier. "Brightening agents are key to helping create that radiant glow associated with dewy skin," Dr. Paul says. Vitamin C, a potent antioxidant found in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Navinka 3OC Daily Vitamin C Serum</a> ($75), helps stimulate collagen production while protecting the skin from environmental damage and reducing hyperpigmentation for a more even complexion.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hydrate Well</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Graf, regularly moisturizing the skin, especially after exfoliating it, is critical in achieving dewy skin. Start by applying an essence or hydrating toner, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Laniege Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer</a> ($36), before layering on a gentle moisturizer, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Untoxicated Lightweight Hydrate Moisturizing Lotion</a> ($25) or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Alpyn Ghostberry Barrier Repair Cream</a> ($62) will help hydrate the skin and give the skin a dewy finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Graf adds that serums and gel moisturizers, which provide a natural sheen rather than a heavy or oily look, focus on hydration to help plump the skin. "Humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin help retain moisture in the skin, so if you want dewy skin, use a moisturizer twice daily," says Dr. Wolinsky. Other hydrating ingredients include ceramides, lipids, squalene, snail mucin, and glycerin, which help restore the skin barrier and nourish the skin, leaving it well hydrated.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your skin needs a boost in the glow and dew department, a hydrating mist like<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Masktini Woke Bae Whenever Moisture Spritz</a> ($65) can help. Most facial sprays and mists contain moisturizing agents that trap moisture for a quick blast of hydration for added dewiness.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Massage Your Skin</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regularly massaging the skin can help rev up blood circulation to give a natural flushness to the skin. When the skin's blood flow is optimal, it's less likely to appear dull and lifeless. Some ingredients in skincare serums and creams, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>niacinamide</a>, for example, can help stimulate healthy blood flow for glowing, dewy skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Add a Little Makeup</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Once you've covered all your bases in the skincare department and still want a little extra oomph, the right makeup can help you out. "Some makeup primers can be effective at giving skin a dewy appearance with built-in subtle shimmer and glow," Dr. Graf says. Apply a super glow primer before dabbing on a few drops of highlighter or swiping it on in stick form—we like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NYX Jumbo Multi-Use Highlighter Stick</a> ($8) can help."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Don't Discount Your Diet</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drinking water can help hydrate the body from the inside out. Skin cells need water to look plump, hydrated, and dewy, but drinking eight glasses daily isn't the only way to do it. Eating healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, salmon, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidant-rich berries, can help maintain the skin's health and prevent dryness. Dr. Wolinsky adds that diets high in sugar can affect inflammation within the skin. And alcohol can suck the life right out of your skin. "Avoid drinking too much alcohol because it is a diuretic and dehydrates the skin," Dr. Graf adds.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-office-procedures-for-dewy-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In-Office Procedures for Dewy Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite your best efforts at home, these are some in-office treatments that dermatologists consider the tried-and-true treatments for getting dewy skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Facials and Chemical Peels</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;Treating your skin to a facial every month or so will help combat a buildup of dead skin cells for skin that boasts a healthy glow. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chemical peels</a> are often an add-on treatment to facials, and they pack a more serious exfoliating punch. Dr. Graf adds that in addition to chemical peels, Derma Sweep (microdermabrasion with infusion) and HydraFacials are all beneficial for achieving dewy skin. "These treatments exfoliate and nourish the skin with super serums that give the skin a glowing and refreshed appearance."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Microneedling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the more under-the-radar advantages of microneedling is that the treatment can help boost hydration levels. Dr. Lal shares that microneedling and radiofrequency microneedling treatments can create a glowy effect by stimulating collagen production, increasing elastin and even hyaluronic acid, making the skin dewier.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lasers</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Discoloration and even skin texture are major players in the quest for dewy skin, which is where laser treatments come into play. Dr. Paul likes to use appropriate lasers to target uneven tone and texture and improve the appearance of pores, with the final result being healthy, dewy, glowing skin. Clear + Brilliant, a baby fractional laser treatment, can also help reduce pore size, which Dr. Wolinksy says can lead to smoother texture. You should maintain the results of in-office procedures with repeat treatments every few months and take care of the skin with the proper skincare regimen.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Boosters</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;The newest injectable treatment at your doctor's office is skin boosters, which use small amounts of hyaluronic acid in a microdroplet delivery system to treat the cheeks for smoother skin and increased hydration. Dr. Lal says Skinvive helps hydrate the deeper layers of the skin, making it appear dewier on the surface. But one treatment that he says you may think may do wonders for your dewy factor but doesn't is Botox. "It can dry the skin and make it appear less dewy and glowy."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-your-glow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain Your Glow</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've achieved optimal dewiness, keeping the skin looking that way is essential—and it's not all that hard. Following a proper skincare routine will help the skin retain its glow. Dr. Graf suggests simplifying your maintenance needs and using a complete skincare routine program such as<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Arbonne DermResults Advanced 5-Step Regimen</a> ($334). "It includes everything you need for dewy skin, including hyaluronic acid and a toning essence with mandelic and phytic acids to exfoliate and boost skin." Or keep on doing what you're doing—if it's worked this far, there's no reason to stop.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w56usmWjoLaveZdsa3FrZWU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hotel-marina-riviera-review-amalfi-coast-italy.html><span>←</span><span>Hotel Marina Riviera Review, Amalfi Coast, Italy</span></a>
