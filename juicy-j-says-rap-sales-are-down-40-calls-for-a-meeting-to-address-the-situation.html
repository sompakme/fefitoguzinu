We gotta figure some shit out. We gotta sit down and talk. Let’s have a meeting, let’s meet up somewhere and have a big ass fucking meeting. Let’s talk about this shit, how we can turn this shit around. Because this is how we eat. This is how we make money.” Fans shared their theories on the cause of a drop in sales on social media in response. Commenting on a post from TheHipHopWolf on Instagram,&nbsp;one user wrote: “Y’all are not making art anymore. A lot of y’all need to relearn what art is then you may be able to create something of value.” Another added: “Sales down but streams aint. Yall gotta demand more from these streaming services. They're getting rich off the artist and only paying them half a penny.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-juicy-j-on-the-future-of-hip-hop>Juicy J On The <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a> Of Hip-Hop</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Juicy J isn't the only voice to speak on the state of hip-hop this week.
