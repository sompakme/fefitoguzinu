In the past, it was less realistic to expect that people would be able to join in across the world with part of a&nbsp;coronation service, but now with the nature of <a class=hm-link href=#>TV and streaming</a>, it has seemingly been decided that including everyone for part of the service would make sense.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Learn all about King Charles III's ancient coronation traditions and rituals</figure><p id=er10_zdTd4l data-wc=50>While announcing the new tradition, <strong>Lambeth Palace</strong> said it hoped the significant change to the historic service would result in <strong>a "great cry around the nation and around the world of support for the King" from those watching on television, online or gathered in the open air at big screens</strong>.</p><p id=ey6XQ-yrUyt data-wc=61>A spokesman for Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop's office, continued: "The Homage of the People is particularly exciting because [it's] brand new. [It's] something that we can share in because of technological advances, so not just the people in the Abbey, but people who are online, on television, who are listening, and who are gathered in parks, at big screens and churches."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="King Charles' III's coronation timetable: an hour-by-hour guide" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4eab16a0e1f2-landscape-fullscreen-750pxh.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="King Charles' III's coronation timetable: an hour-by-hour guide" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>King Charles' III's coronation timetable: an hour-by-hour guide</a></h5></li></ul><p id=eDgb0q_lwl8 data-wc=55>The Homage of the People will replace the traditional Homage of Peers during which a long line of hereditary peers used to kneel and make a pledge to the monarch in person. The purpose of both oaths remains the same, however: to represent the pledge taker's dedication to the monarch as the monarch is crowned.</p><h2><strong>How do you pledge allegiance to King Charles?</strong></h2><p id=ejo3FTp3MkUr data-wc=35>During King Charles III's coronation <a class=hm-link href=#>service in Westminster Abbey</a> on 6 May 2023, members of the public will be invited to join in with a moment in the ceremony named the Homage of the People.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/652914198792-king-charles-pledge-coronation-king-charles.jpg><p id=evMAEl2A_TR0 data-wc=52>At this point in the service, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will ask that "all persons of goodwill in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and of the other realms and the territories to make their homage, in heart and voice, to their undoubted King, defender of all."</p><p id=eGzJMTx40E data-wc=8><strong>DISCOVER: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How much will King Charles' coronation cost?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=euIRWUYaOQ2y data-wc=60>Then, all in the Abbey as well as those watching at home will be called upon to respond with this oath:&nbsp;"I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God." Following this moment, a fanfare will be played by the King's trumpeters in Westminster Abbey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d19b2e2d7b37-king-charles-pledge-coronation-throne-1.jpg><p id=egoh2PrJMZO- data-wc=38>The Archbishop will then say: "God save the King," to which the public watching all around the world will be invited to respond with "God save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King live for ever."</p><h2><strong>Do I have to swear allegiance to the King?</strong></h2><p id=eTlT74eZdT0r data-wc=52>No, instructions have been clear that the pledge of allegiance is an entirely voluntary moment during the coronation. No one is required to take this oath at home. Indeed, the order of service itself will be calling only upon "all who so desire, in the Abbey, and elsewhere" to say the oath.</p><p id=e9WHe11RMW8 data-wc=23></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhsaWaGdH6OsJ%2BarF2ZvKa%2FjKmjnpyXmnqiuMuenqKZnpiybsDOZquhnV2gtq%2BzjKacmqZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shameik-moore-sorry-for-across-the-spider-verse-oscars-loss-reaction.html><span>←</span><span>Shameik Moore Sorry for Across the Spider-Verse Oscars Loss Reaction</span></a>
