This is why, when searching for the right type of undergarments, you need to ask yourself: what’s important to me and my southern partner?"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Besides the household name, there’s a reason they’re at the top of the game: they just get underwear. Ticking all the boxes across durability, breathability and style, you’d be hard pressed finding a better pair.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.uniqlo.com rel=sponsored>Uniqlo Supima Cotton Boxer Briefs, Uniqlo, $9.90</a></b></p><p>When it comes to underwear, going budget isn’t always the best idea, but as per usual Uniqlo is the exception to the rule. Designed with added stretch, I suggest going a size up for added comfort!</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.uniqlo.com rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>BEST BRIEFS</b></span></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=cdlp.com rel=sponsored>CDLP 3-pack Y-Brief, CDLP, $120</a></b></p><p>A new player in the game, but don’t let that fool you – CDLP has taken the competition by storm. Using a fabric called Lyocell, sourced sustainably from wood, the underwear boasts a silk-like feeling without compromising on the benefits of a cotton-wear. A game changer that I recommend.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=cdlp.com rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Calvin Klein Cotton Classics 4-pack, Myer, $89.95</a></b></p><p>Back on the list, Calvin Klein is revered for its briefs. Stocked in the largest range of colourways, you will not be starved for choice. However, with durability in mind, I highly recommend sticking to black.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>BEST TRUNKS</b></span></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Tommy Hilfiger 3-pack Premium Essentials Trunks, Myer, $99.95</a></b></p><p>The reviews don’t lie! Seriously loved by the public, the microfibre waistband will ensure maximum all-day comfort on the hips. Also, let me not understate the posterior support: who doesn’t love a 24/7 lift in the behind?</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Polo Ralph Lauren 3-pack Stretch Trunks, The Iconic, $99.95</a></b></p><p>Ralph Lauren engenders so much adoration from its legions of followers, that it was only natural they released an underwear line: and boy am I thankful. Made with stretch cotton, the underwear allows for both support and comfort. A top-drawer essential.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><span class=h2>BEST BOXERS</span></b></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Hanro Sporty Cotton Boxers, The Iconic, $89.95</a></b></p><p>I cannot overstate just how soft these boxers are. Using mercerised cotton (it’s increases fabric strength and gives it a silky appearance), the HANRO Sporty Cotton boxers are serious players in the comfort and durability department. Light-weight cotton will always be a winner and is a fantastic everyday option.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.bodenclothing.com.au rel=sponsored>Boden 3-pack Woven Boxers, Boden, $80</a></b></p><p>Now, if you’re bored of the plain spread that the underwear market is offering, Boden has you covered. With a nod to the classic boxer design, these boxers are made with a refined waistband that ensures they won’t glide south.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.bodenclothing.com.au rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>BEST ATHLETIC/SPORTS UNDERWEAR</b></span></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.lululemon.com.au rel=sponsored>Built to Move Boxer “5, Lululemon, $39</a></b></p><p>These underwear are built for high-sweat movement, with a focus on both comfort and breathability. Sweat-wicking Lycra fibre, and extreme room in the pouch, Lululemon is ensuring we’re ticking boxes here people.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.lululemon.com.au rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.amazon.com rel=sponsored>ExOfficio Give-n-Go Boxer Brief, Amazon, $45</a></b></p><p>Performance underwear should be intuitive: it should move with your body, not against it. ExOfficio’s underwear range honours the athlete, providing compact underwear that is quick to dry and a second skin.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.amazon.com rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>WHAT IS THE BEST FABRIC FOR UNDERWEAR?</b></span></p><p>It depends. For day-to-day wear, I suggest 100 per cent cotton. They’re light, breathable and surprisingly regulate temperature quite well – thank god for that. For something more heavy duty – worn during exercise, say – technical fabrics are where it’s at. They’re designed for function, and are ace at wicking away any moisture that may come about when hitting the gym.</p><p><span class=h2><b>HOW MANY PAIRS OF UNDERWEAR SHOULD YOU OWN?</b></span></p><p>At any given time, there should be 10-12 pairs in your wardrobe. When considering workouts, social activities, and general day-to-day living, this number is the hill that I will die on. Trust me!</p><p><span class=h2><b>HOW DO YOU KEEP WAISTBANDS FROM OVER-STRETCHING?</b></span></p><p>Elastic waistbands love a cold wash, and low-heat dry settings. Really, anything anti-heat, and they will thrive. Also, just be gentle on the tug.</p><p><i>Kurt Hughes is a Sydney-based journalist who has his finger on the trigger when it comes to the trends and styles.
