Coming off of a heated battle with Meek Mill that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">revealed the use of ghostwriters</a>, Drake embarked on a mission to become the biggest artist of all time. Though his aspirations to become the biggest rapper came as a result, he took a leap of faith when he began the rollout. On April 5th, 2016, he released the two-piece EP consisting of “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Pop Style</a>” ft. The Throne and “One Dance.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The former doesn’t necessarily rank high in Drake’s catalog. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>’s contributions were kept to four bars while <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> slid through with some extravagant flexes for her verse. However, “One Dance” became an unexpected success that undoubtedly defined Drake’s career. “One Dance” ushered in Drake’s formal takeover with assistance from Kyla and WizKid. With records like “Hotline Bling,” Drizzy showcased his versatility and his range within R&B. However, “One Dance” took him to global acclaim beyond the meme-inspiring single.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-one-dance-turns-7>Drake’s “One Dance” Turns 7</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake’s fusion of R&B with tones of dancehall and afrobeats undoubtedly shaped the sound of pop music moving forward. The mesmerizing production and the sample of Kyla’s “​​Do You Mind (Crazy Cousinz remix)” pair perfectly with Drizzy’s smooth melodic performance and the accents of WizKid’s production. It's hard not to acknowledge how plenty of the pop records that came after followed a similar blueprint. At this point, “One Dance” stands as an iconic anthem that, these days, feels like a blast of nostalgia. Last year, UK rapper Ardee sampled the song for “Hello Mate”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Beyond the anniversary of Drizzy’s classic #1 smash, the rapper is currently gearing up to hit the road for the It’s All A Blur tour. This summer, Drake and 21 Savage will be hitting the road across America and Canada for a co-headlining venture in support of Her Loss. Most recently, the rapper appeared at Dreamville Fest in Raleigh, NC for a joint set with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a> and brought out guests like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, Lil Wayne, and of course, 21 Savage.
