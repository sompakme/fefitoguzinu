Not only are other rappers throwing in their two cents (<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">or 50 cents, we should say</a>), but it revived general interest in the circumstances behind the West Coast legend's tragic loss. Moreover, folks within these inner circles with more firsthand experience with these figures are vouching for them. For example, former Bad Boy bodyguard Gene Deal spoke to The Art Of Dialogue on Thursday (October 26) about this debacle. He didn't claim to have any solid information on whether Puff did anything, but he knows that his client knew Duane "Keefe D" Davis, the main suspect in the case who is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">currently in custody</a> and accused of taking orders from the mogul in many's eyes in the rap community.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Keefe D, I’ve seen him a number of times,” the security guard expressed. “[He and Diddy] were gambling together, they were drinking together, they had fun, they was hanging out in hotels. Yes, they did have a relationship. As far as me having any information&nbsp;whether he commissioned Keefe D to do a murder, nah bruh, that ain’t me. They can ask me, did I see Keefe D? Yes, I did. Was he around? Yes, he was."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy-s-ex-bodyguard-s-convo-with-the-art-of-dialogue-watch>Diddy's Ex-Bodyguard's Convo With The Art Of Dialogue: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Deal stated that, if asked to do so by the case, he would testify and has nothing to hide. However, during another Art Of Dialogue conversation last month, he broke down <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">what he thinks happened to 'Pac</a>. "Well, the story I heard, which was portrayed in the&nbsp;Murder Rap movie or whatever," the guard explained. "It was [ex-detective] Greg Kading’s accounts that supposedly Keefe D gave. If you ever been in an interrogation or anything that has to do with some law enforcement, right? Before they get to that videotape, before they get to that camera, it’s already written down what you’re going to say. They going to tell you what they need for you to say and how they need for you to think. What you need to do to get out this situation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"And Keefe D, no disrespect," he concluded. "To me, he did what he had to do to walk home. He said what he had to say to be a free man. All the players is dead right now. He’s the only spade left on the table. He gon’ win or he gon’ lose."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZ4Z1gpNmm6KclK56rLHEn5xmnF2bvLO5xKtkm6eUrrS2rdGdZKmZk2K6tr7DnqlmoJmleqm7z2alnq%2Bj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yella-beezy-looks-on-the-bright-side-after-nudes-leak.html><span>←</span><span>Yella Beezy Looks On The Bright Side After Nudes Leak</span></a>
