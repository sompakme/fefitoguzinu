In a smaller percentage of the population, you get associated symptoms that can be very scary. One that's commonly reported is a sense of a presence — something or someone in the room with you.</p><p>"You can also get hallucinations where you see dark shadows or monstrous figures, you can get auditory hallucinations — you hear voices, footsteps — and also tactile hallucinations.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"You can feel as if you're being held, you might feel as if someone is breathing on the back of your neck, you can feel as if you're being dragged out of the bed.</p><p>"During a normal night's sleep, you go through different stages and it's REM sleep that's associated with vivid dreams."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZrCnnZa7br7Er5yapKNiwKbEjKWgn51drLa1tIygn6irpKh6tK3YrGSsoJWhuW66xK%2Bcq2WXpHqjrcKkZK2nXaKyr3u1j4eKh4KFl4OdppGDf4JjiX%2BGgaJ9bICHcWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./usha-vance-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Usha Vance Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</span></a>
