Further, the rapper revealed that the Instagram photo of the two love birds was simply a promotional shot for his "Show Me" music video, in which the couple stars as lovers. “We’re not [together],” he told the outlet. “Well, honestly, it wasn’t anything that wasn’t anticipated at first, but when we got back all the assets, like the photos, you know, I started to kind of like, ‘Oh, there’s something that could be done with these.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>This could tell the story.</a>’ So that’s kinda what I wanted to do. I knew it was gonna catch people by surprise a little bit. That was the hardest part, was kinda waiting 48 hours, to like, you know I mean? They was wilin.'"</p><p>It seems as though, however, he's since had a change of heart. Joey Bada$$ later confirmed their romantic relationship in June, with a birthday post calling Serayah his <a href=# rel>"love."</a> He shared a similarly heartfelt series of photos and clips, showing the couple enjoying a tropical vacation together.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Joey Badass Albums & Mixtapes, Ranked</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZX1xgJRmoaidqWKvorDArKpmq5Wnrrqtx2akqKaklrSm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-it-better-to-travel-with-cash-or-card.html><span>←</span><span>Is it Better to Travel with Cash or Card?</span></a>
