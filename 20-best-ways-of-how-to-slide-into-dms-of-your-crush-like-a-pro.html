Usually, the person who is sliding into DMs is messaging their crush in a confident and flirty manner.</p><h2>Is it ok to slide into DMs?</h2><p class=align-left>Is it appropriate to slide into DMs?</p><p class=align-left>If it is done in a respectful and non-pushy way, it is completely okay to start a conversation with someone in this manner.</p><p class=align-left>However, the whole "slide into my DMs" culture has achieved a questionable reputation, because many people end up being creepy and annoying towards the other person.</p><h2>How to slide into DMs - a complete guide</h2><p class=align-left>Here are all the things you should remember when you are trying to start a conversation online. Check out this how to slide into DMs 101 guide.</p><h3>1. Be ready for any outcome</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a girl: Simple tips to get you started</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Remember that there is no guarantee the person sees your message and responds to it, and they do not owe you their attention.</p><p class=align-left>Be prepared to move on if it does not work out with this particular person. Do not continue bothering them and getting upset about their not replying, since this is extremely unattractive.</p><h3>2. Follow them</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03126a5bec4472e2.jpg><p class=align-left>It would seem a little weird and out of the blue if you start messaging this person without following them. Additionally, it would be preferable if they followed you back, otherwise, it may feel a little one-sided.</p><h3>3. Make a good first impression</h3><p class=align-left>You can send them an opening message only once, and this is your shot to make yourself memorable.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, some generic pickup lines or "hey, how are you" are out of the question. It is not creative at all, and will most likely make the person not want to respond.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03951a3819e95955.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the no contact rule and is it really effective?</span></p></a><h3>4. Say something meaningful</h3><p class=align-left>Saying things like "hey gorgeous" is not very likely to work, since this person has probably received plenty of similar messages already, and ignored them all due to lack of creativity.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, you can comment on something you saw on their profile, and try to establish a connection from there.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, you can ask a question about a vacation place they have been to, make a joke about something they posted, or compliment their dog. This will give them a better reason to reply to you.</p><h3>5. Try to avoid messaging complete strangers</h3><p class=align-left>People on the internet are wary of creepy stalkers, and it is easy to seem like one when you are messaging someone you have no mutual friends with.</p><p class=align-left>This means that you should try to text people who you have actually met before, or those who are in your social circle. This way, you will be more approachable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><h3>6. DMs are not a dating app - do not treat them as such</h3><p class=align-left>Do not forget that while you may be searching for a romantic connection, the other person does not share your intentions.</p><p class=align-left>If you are on Tinder, you know both of you want the same thing, and it may be easy to turn the conversation romantic. However, if you are messaging someone on their personal social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), you are unaware whether they are looking for the same thing as you.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes, they may get interested in you with time and grow to like you romantically. Still, there is also a chance that they see you as a friend to have casual chats with, and are not interested in anything romantic for plenty of reasons.</p><h3>7. Do not like a lot of their pictures</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg><p class=align-left>If you saw a beautiful person on Instagram and are considering liking all their pictures, you better reconsider this decision.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/668921dddc49f2a5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop thinking about someone: The best tips</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It seems stalkerish when someone likes multiple pictures of you dating back to a few years ago and comments on each one. If you want to get their attention, you can like one or two recent pictures and leave a single comment.</p><h3>8. Do not be creepy</h3><p class=align-left>A lot of people make the mistake of opening their message with crude and sexual jokes or pickup lines. Sometimes, they even send explicit pictures of their private parts.</p><p class=align-left>Unless you want the person to be grossed out, do not send anything like this. Show that you respect them as a person and that you do not consider them to be an object designed to satisfy your desires.</p><h3>9. Do not shower them with compliments straight away</h3><p class=align-left>It is fine to make a little compliment about their looks or anything that you saw on their profile. However, you will only come off as clingy and desperate if you start showering them with multiple compliments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bc8f001e2d7b4e12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to ask someone out and succeed in getting a date</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, do not make the mistake of admiring their appearance a little too much. They can think you are shallow and like them only for their beautiful face or body.</p><h3>10. Do not overthink everything you send</h3><p class=align-left>Sure, you should think a little bit before sending your texts, but worrying about every word will not do you any good. Just try to be yourself if you want the person to like you for who you are.</p><h3>11. Plan your responses wisely</h3><p class=align-left>Once you start talking to someone, you may think it would be a good idea to instantly respond to each of their texts without giving them space. Or, alternatively, you may want to seem mysterious and often leave the person hanging.</p><p class=align-left>Both of these tactics may cause trouble and paint you as someone who is either desperate or losing interest. Just reply at a normal pace and let the conversation flow naturally.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3cfbf44ea653710d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Am I in love? 20 signs that you love someone</span></p></a><h3>12. Do not send too many emojis</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b1713976b876a3a.jpg><p class=align-left>When you message someone with romantic intentions, you want to do it nonchalantly. Sending plenty of emoji reactions just feels like coming on too strongly.</p><h3>13. Do not send messages when they are not responding</h3><p class=align-left>We have all had this one person who constantly sends "hey" texts and is not bothered by you not replying. This will not make your crush want to reply and is only going to put them off even further.</p><p class=align-left>In other words, if you see there is no chemistry, you should accept it and move on.</p><p class=align-left>These are the main answers to the question "How do you slide into your DMs successfully?".</p><h2>What to say when you slide into DMs - effective tips</h2><p class=align-left>Every person thinks "if you slide into my DM, it had better be worthwhile".
