However, it seems that this title run was something The Icon had objected to.</p><p>According to a new report by Fightful Select, Sting outrightly refused the creative decision to win the tag team titles and even resisted competing for them for a long time.</p><p>The report stated that since the duo of The WCW Franchise and Darby Allin had been undefeated as a unit, they were destined to compete for the tag titles from a creative standpoint. The conclusion mentioned that this direction was planned for a long time and everybody was happy backstage after Sting and Darby’s victory.</p><p>“Sting is now an AEW Tag Team Champion, but he likely wouldn’t have been if he had his way. Sting and Dary Allin emerged victorious on the February 7 Dynamite, just under one month away from Sting’s retirement match at AEW Revolution 2024. In beating Ricky Starks and Big Bill, the duo became AEW Tag Team Champions. We’re told that not only was Sting adamantly and long against winning the AEW Tag Team Titles, for a long time he was against even competing for them. However, some in AEW said that from their standpoint, Sting and Darby were undefeated as a tag team, and should have had a title shot well before within the context of the television show. We’re told the decision was made well in advance for Sting and Allin to win the tag team titles, and Sting went along with it. Those we spoke to said he was all smiles after the match backstage.”</p><p>Sting and Darby Allin defeated former champions Big Bill and Absolute Ricky Starks to capture the tag team gold. <a href=#>However, they were ambushed by their next opponents, The Young Bucks following their win</a>.</p><p>Both teams will now clash for the AEW World tag team championships at AEW Revolution in March 2024, the show that will see Sting compete for the very last time inside a squared circle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Are you excited to see Sting and Darby Allin vs The Young Bucks?
