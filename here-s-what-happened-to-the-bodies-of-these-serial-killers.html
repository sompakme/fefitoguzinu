Between 1974 and 1978 he killed more than 30 people, often using good looks and charm to lure good samaritans to their deaths. According to <a href=#>Men's Health</a>, his January 24, 1989 execution was the sort of event that everyone stopped, watched, and waited for news on.&nbsp;Bundy had actually gotten the death penalty for three separate trials, and still, he spent nine years in prison before someone actually flipped the switch on the electric chair at the Florida State Penitentiary, and when he was taken out of the prison, the crowds lining the streets outside cheered as the car bearing his body drove past. (They'd previously been cheering, "Burn, Bundy, burn!")</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Esquire</a> says Bundy's brain was examined for any physical explanations that might give researchers a clue just why he had been driven to kill so many people in such terrible ways, but his brain had none of the abnormalities or signs of trauma scientists expected to see.</p><p dir=ltr>Afterwards, Bundy's very eerie final request was fulfilled: he was cremated, and his ashes were returned to Washington state, where they were scattered in the Cascade Mountains. Why is that eerie? That's where he had disposed of (at least) four of the people he'd killed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAj21waWpfnbKzsdJmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG7Ax55km6eUnrK0ec6fZK2glaiybr%2FEq6CapF2gtq24xKuqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denise-crosby-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Denise Crosby Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
