He was previously projected to get out on July 23, 2023. Mozzy initially turned himself over to authorities at the United States Penitentiary Atwater in July of last year.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The arrested stems from a traffic stop a few months prior, during which officers did a search of the car after smelling marijuana. They found a Glock 26, 16 rounds of 9mm ammunition and a “personal use” amount of marijuana. He was booked but released after posting $35,000 bail. While Mozzy is yet to confirm his release from prison, court documents obtained by HipHopDX show that he is a free man as of Thursday, May 4. He did have to pay a $55,000 fine, however.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-mozzy-at-rolling-loud>Mozzy At Rolling Loud</h2></span><p>SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 10: Mozzy performs during Rolling Loud at NOS Events Center on December 10, 2021 in San Bernardino, California.

The project was his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">first under Yo Gotti’s CMG imprint</a>. It featured appearances from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Roddy Ricch</a>, Shordie Shordie, EST Gee, Blac Youngsta, and Moneybagg Yo. More recently, Mozzy dropped an EP titled, Kollect Kalls, last month. That effort features collaborations with YFN Lucci, Celly Ru, E MOZZY, and Baby Money.&nbsp;Additionally, he recently appeared on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Drama</a>’s&nbsp;I’m Really Like That for the song, "Been A While.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Mozzy first inked a deal with CMG back in February. Discussing the deal during the label’s 2022 Press Conference in Los Angeles, he described the moment as “long overdue.” “Overdue, overdue, out the gate,” he said at the time. “Big dawg been tappin’ in with me. I’m talkin’ about even before a n***a career even popped … We had conversations, he told me there was a seat at the table. I had to get my life right, tie up a couple of loose ends. I tied them motherfuckas up, we here now.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
