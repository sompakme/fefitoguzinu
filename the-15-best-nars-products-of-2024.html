His goal? To share his love of lipstick and to see if people would buy cosmetics with his name on them. Fast forward roughly 30 years, and it’s safe to say NARS has become a household name — only now, the brand is beloved for far <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>more than just its lipstick</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Many brands have one or two star products, but I can honestly say that there is no big weak point at NARS,” says NARS senior makeup artist Julia Sohn. While that may sound biased (given her connection with the brand), we can attest to just how incredible NARS is. Not only do we personally love a variety of the brand’s products, but many of them have claimed the overall top spots in our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle lab tests</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Suffice to say, if NARS hasn’t made its way into your cosmetic case yet, it’s only a matter of time before you realize how iconic (and pigmented and easy to use) the formulas are. Ahead, uncover the 15 best NARS products of 2024.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-universal-nars-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Universal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Blush in Orgasm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vNxHlpXdz_TIDxD-EuQWL4H4eH0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Blush-in-Orgasm-d66149a703d1483888cdb1f80d6a54c8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sold in over 15 shades, so there’s something for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish every shade was available in mini size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ever since it debuted in 1999, the NARS Blush in the iconic shade Orgasm has been a cult favorite. Often referred to as the most universal blush in existence, Orgasm is found in almost every makeup artist kit and tops virtually every ‘best powder blush’ roundups — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>including our own</a>. Beyond its perfect pink color, the blush is highly pigmented and incredibly blendable, not to mention buildable, so it’s extremely easy to apply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, the color offerings have expanded to include 15 shades that compliment every skin tone. Aside from Orgasm, we’re also fond of the Orgasm X hue: The peachy-pink powder is sprinkled with glistening gold flecks, which instantly offers a more sun-kissed look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only complaint about this blush is that of the 15 shades offered, only two are sold in mini versions. But that’s not so much a product flaw as it is an opportunity for an improved product offering. (In other words, please give us all the minis, NARS!)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.16 oz |<strong> Shades: </strong>15<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Pressed powder blush with rich, buildable pigment</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-nars-light-reflecting-advanced-skincare-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nars Light Reflecting Advanced Skincare Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nars Light Reflecting Advanced Skincare Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7G8bX7GC-nx37pahQm2dQDaheWY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Light-Reflecting-Advanced-Skincare-Foundation-386540ef86514196bb60ab9ec4af0a73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sold in 36 shades and works wonderfully to even out skin tone without settling into pores or fine lines.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The formula is on the watery side, which can become messy if not properly stored.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is the NARS Light Reflecting Advanced Skincare Foundation the best foundation from the brand, it’s also our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite liquid foundation of all time</a>. When we tested 27 top-rated foundations (spanning all price points), we found that none compare to the radiant finish and lightweight feel of this formula, which is sold in a whopping 36 shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this foundation works beautifully to create an even canvas, it also has skincare benefits. The silky formula is infused with redness-reducing biomimetic oat, moisture barrier-supporting Japanese lilyturf, and blue light-fighting milk thistle. Because of these ingredients, this pick makes skin look fabulous while also protecting it against environmental aggressors that could affect its longterm health and appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz |<strong> Shades: </strong>36<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Contains ingredients to support the skin barrier and reduce redness</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-concealer-nars-radiant-creamy-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Concealer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W2INVj6c47PfEProoaDkOS2IsxQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nars-radiant-creamy-concealer-9e96dfbe91b2481ab1644d83fb055227.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The creamy formula blends beautifully to give a second skin finish — and it’s sold in mini size so you can easily stow a touch-up tube in your purse for on-the-go use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If it’s over-applied, it may crease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>iconic concealers of all time</a>, this creamy, lightweight formula is infused with tone-balancing and fine line-diffusing mineral powders, as well as a hydrating, redness-reducing botanical blend. What does this mean? Simply put, a light swipe of this concealer will quickly camouflage whatever any imperfections — from dark under-eye circles to blemishes, and even hyperpigmentation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, the formula can crease if you apply too much. With this in mind, be sure to brush any excess concealer off the doe-foot wand before dotting it onto your face.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.22 oz |<strong> Shades: </strong>30<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Lightweight formula provides a second skin-like finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-primer-nars-radiance-primer-spf-35></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Primer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Radiance Primer SPF 35</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Radiance Primer SPF 35" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ClEoQz6jF5VS2S4xxmswpyAAPc8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Radiance-Primer-SPF-35-ec20dcff05c94ff1980aa1b76a7db397.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It makes makeup last longer and look smoother, but it also works well as a no-makeup makeup product.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s a small tube for the price.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For your makeup to last all day (and night), a primer is a must. And if you ask Sohn, nothing compares to NARS Radiance Primer SPF 35. “This primer is so beautiful both underneath makeup and on its own,” she says. “It gives skin a beautiful lit from within glow without being shimmery or overly obvious.” Additionally, she says that since it’s formulated with hyaluronic acid, it adds a boost of moisture to the skin, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We do wish the tube was a bit bigger given the price. Still, due to the stay-all-day results, it’s worth the splurge in our book.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>1 | <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Revives dull-looking skin and promotes longer makeup wear</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-setting-powder-nars-light-reflecting-loose-setting-powder></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Setting Powder</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Loose Setting Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pgb7oGOGdw5VvgX76GVLIsXu2_Y=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Light-Reflecting-Loose-Setting-Powder-6a766be5a0404e4cb458ca99d01f251f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sold in four shades, all of which feature a pop top under the screw top to keep the powder from spilling everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If over-applied, it can potentially lead to flashback.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just as primer ensures that your beautiful face beat lives up to its full potential, setting powder keeps every product in place for a long-lasting, flawless-looking complexion. While NARS sells both loose and pressed setting powders, Sohn recommends opting for the former. “It is so incredibly lightweight that it doesn’t leave a trace of powderiness on the skin,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the powder can be used all over the face, Sohn especially loves it for under-eyes, particularly to set concealer. “A lot of people, especially with more mature skin, are afraid to use powder under the eye for fear that it will make skin look more textured,” she explains. “This weightless powder is so finely milled that it doesn’t emphasize fine lines and wrinkles and helps to prevent creasing throughout the day.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we appreciate the shade range, the translucent option (which is actually white) can lead to flashback. As such, be sure to tap excess powder off your brush before sweeping it over your face.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>0.38 oz |<strong> Shades: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Cements makeup in place while blurring the appearance of fine lines</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-eyeshadow-nars-hardwired-single-eyeshadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Eyeshadow</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Single Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Hardwired single Eyeshadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KZ7jap_guDaAS31oqHbyrgoe07o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Hardwired-Single-Eyeshadow-275b3ee01bdc4431b1836452e35bdc7a.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The velvety formula features gorgeous hues with metallic and shimmer finishes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish the shadow was sold in a wider variety of shades.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tired of wasting your money on 12-pan eyeshadow palettes when you typically only end up using one or two shades? Sohn recommends filling your makeup bag with NARS Hardwired Single Eyeshadow — particular in the shade Galapagos.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is a staple in my kit,” Sohn reveals. “It’s a rich chocolate matte brown with a gold fleck running through it. It works well on everyone, regardless of skin tone or age — the gold fleck doesn’t increase the look of texture on the lid, but draws light to the eyes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As wonderful as the formula is, it’s a shame it’s only sold in 18 rather earthy shades. While there are some pinks and purples to choose from, we’d love to see vivid brights like fuchsia, tangerine, and turquoise.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.04 oz |<strong> Shades: </strong>18<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Feature: </strong>Metallic and shimmery formulas that don’t settle into fine lines</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-eye-primer-nars-smudge-proof-eyeshadow-base></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Eye Primer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Eyeshadow Base</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_7y600HRWHaWZl7Nbnk08ypWZ6o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Smudge-Proof-Eyeshadow-Base-590fa8fad4b643acb89153820f36cab4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It works well to prevent eye makeup from smudging while also promoting longer wear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The oddly-long handle of the wand is a bit cumbersome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter how long-lasting an eyeshadow claims to be, it never hurts to preface it with a high-quality primer beforehand. Our pick? The NARS Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>outperformed 28 other eyeshadow primers in our lab test</a>.
