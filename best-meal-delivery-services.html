The fare ventures into sustainably sourced seafood, turkey, Mary’s chicken, brown rice, blue cheese and eggs, while barbecue-glazed tofu, mushroom carnitas and GP’s Soccata (pan-seared, seasoned chickpea-kale-feta cubes) stand in for meat. And recyclable packaging includes smart slots on top to hold sauce containers for dipping to preempt sogginess or spills.
