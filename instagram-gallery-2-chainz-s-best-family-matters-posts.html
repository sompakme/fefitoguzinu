If not, we'll give you a hint, it's posted all over his Instagram feed and shows that 2 Chainz has a soft side. If you couldn't guess by now, that thing we are talking about, oddly but not-so-oddly enough, is parenting and being a family man.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If anyone is deserving of 'Rap's <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Father</a> Of The Year' theoretical Grammy it's 2 Chainz, with company like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a> and more. Whether he is giving praise to his wife Kesha Ward or sharing candid court side pics of himself and his three children - son Halo and two daughters, Harmony and Heave - at numerous Atlanta Hawk's games, Chainz exemplifies what it means to be a good dad and an all around family man.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We took a dive through his feed to bring you a few of his warmest, family oriented moments.

If you're wondering how he pushed through the pain, here's his motivation.</h2></p><p><h2>If you thought 2 Chainz only cares for his immediate family members, think again, because it's BIG FAMILY MOOD at the Chainz estate.</h2></p><p><h2>2 Chainz is now Big OG Drench god, considering his daughters have now taken on the moniker.</h2></p><h2>Ladies, get you a man that will live his best life with you and wear all white to <a href=# class=text-word>Gucci Mane</a>'s wedding.</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZoJ1hJFmoKerpJa0s63MZp6apJyav7p5kWaaoZmZo8e0ecGeqq1llpa6qrjYZqSarKSav7R5z6iqratdo7K4vw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-los-angeles-sales-tax.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is Los Angeles Sales Tax</span></a>
