Any new or unexpected noise will frighten them and send them scurrying. However, once rodents get used to a sound, they will no longer fear it.<h2>Do rats hate garlic?</h2>Garlic. Sprinkle garlic powder or diced garlic cloves to ward off rats. Because garlic is so strong, it attacks the noses of animals with heightend senses of smell, such as rats.

There are also certain types of lights that they may make additional effort to avoid, such as flashing lights. That is why so many companies sell light machines designed to deter rats; they have their basis in fact.<h2>Does vinegar get rid of rats?</h2>The spray is great for both deterrence and cleaning up after rats.
