But every so often I come across a bio that makes me smile, as with one person who wrote that they're looking for someone "always down to get apps for the table." I responded, "apps are life," and I meant it — both in dining, and in the beauty world. Not referring to minis or single-use samples, but sets that give you a healthy dose of a brand's best products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Such is the case with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dermalogica's Age Defense Kit</a>, a three-piece set that unites the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Oprah-blessed brand</a>'s greatest hits into a spectacularly easy routine. It includes the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Daily Superfoliant</a>, a charcoal-infused version of Dermalogica's editor-loved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Daily Microfoliant</a>, along with a bottle of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Biolumin-C Serum</a> and a tube of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 sunscreen</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Full sizes of the three go for $59, $89, and $75, respectively, but the $55 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Age Defense Kit</a> serves up enough of each product for you to personally judge whether they're worth the investment for your skin. Although going by the kit's 400+ five-star reviews, the formulas deliver phenomenal results.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $55; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dermalogica.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"AMAZING skincare. I'm noticing that the wrinkles in my forehead are getting better," wrote one person, while another said, "After only using these products for a week, I can already see a difference in my skin. The fine line and wrinkles around my eyes have already become less noticeable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's thanks to the cruelty-free trio's sophisticated ingredients. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Daily Superfoliant</a> is like the Daily Microfoliant's big sister, combining the Microfoliant's exfoliating enzymes and alpha hydroxy acids with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Binchotan charcoal</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>brightening niacinamide</a>. Half a teaspoon of the powdered formula is a "vital step for relaxing stressed-out facial muscles," according to one shopper who says the product smoothes their wrinkles — a result that 72-year-old reviewers notice as well in their heavy forehead lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Biolumin-C Serum</a> follows with a restorative mix of exfoliation and wrinkle relief, drawing on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>alpha hydroxy acids</a>, vitamin C, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>peptides</a> for both immediate and long-term results. Formulated with chia seed extract, vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, sunflower seed oil, and pagoda tree extract to plump skin, this combination has earned the serum over 800 five-star reviews.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Was skeptical but will definitely purchase again. Fine wrinkles gone, improved complexion, brings a real glow to my skin," a shopper said of the serum's outcomes. Another attested that they've seen impressive brightening and line-reducing effects in a month, although the results were visible straight away (others reported fewer lines in five days). In the words of a 42-year-old mother of three, "I have been noticing the fine lines and wrinkles begin to fade. My skin is feeling smoother and looks younger."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dynamic Skin Recovery sunscreen</a> preserves those results with SPF 50, though it also incorporates an anti-aging moisturizer with the addition of polyphenol-rich antioxidants, peptides, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>squalane</a>, and vitamin E. The hydrating SPF doesn't clog pores or leave a white cast, but goes above and beyond to anti-age. After two years, a 56-year-old shopper said they see far fewer fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's rare for me to write reviews, but this moisturizer is amazing. I was worried about the high price, but it goes a long way," a final person wrote. "Fine lines I've had for years have visibly decreased. My pores are less noticeable also. I have combination skin, but this doesn't cause breakouts or make my skin feel oily."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Try the $55 set yourself</a>, and edge one step closer to livin' la vida Winfrey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLGmvsyao6ifmZiubq3GnmSdnZaau7SxjKSgrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scientology-and-the-prison-of-belief-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>Scientology and the Prison of Belief Trailer</span></a>
