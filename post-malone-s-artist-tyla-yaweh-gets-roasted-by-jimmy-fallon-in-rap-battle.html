Post, Fallon and Tyla made their way to the bar after the "Better Now" singer's appearance on "The Tonight Show."&nbsp;During the first part of the video, Fallon raps, "You like to wear a sweatshirt that says "Joy Rich"/ but really, you're a boy, bitch," which is received to loud applaud by those at the bar and a co-sign from Posty himself. Unfortunately, Tyla's rebuttal wasn't that strong.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clearly, it was all fun as Fallon gave Tyla a hug after all was said and done.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite taking an L in the rap battle against Fallon, Yaweh's been making some serious waves lately.
