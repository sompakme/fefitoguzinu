However, in recent times, fans and analysts have been asking, “What happened to Ezekiel Elliott?” This article delves into the career trajectory of Elliott, exploring his rise to fame, the challenges he has faced, and his current status in the league.</p><h2 id=early-career-and-rise-to-stardom-oClhkUKrMm>Early Career and Rise to Stardom</h2><p>Ezekiel Elliott burst onto the NFL scene with an impressive rookie season. Drafted fourth overall by the Dallas Cowboys in the 2016 NFL Draft, Elliott quickly established himself as one of the league’s premier running backs. His combination of speed, power, and vision led him to lead the league in rushing yards as a rookie. Elliott’s early success was a key factor in the Cowboys’ offensive dominance during his first few seasons.</p><h2 id=contract-negotiations-and-holdout-oClhkUKrMm>Contract Negotiations and Holdout</h2><p>After proving his worth on the field, Elliott sought to secure his financial future with the Cowboys. This led to a high-profile contract holdout before the 2019 season, as Elliott sought a deal that would make him one of the highest-paid running backs in the NFL. The holdout ended with Elliott signing a six-year, $90 million extension, solidifying his place on the team.</p><h2 id=injuries-and-performance-decline-oClhkUKrMm>Injuries and Performance Decline</h2><p>As with many NFL players, injuries have played a role in Elliott’s career. Over the years, he has dealt with various ailments that have affected his performance. Notably, a calf injury in 2020 led to a noticeable decline in his productivity. The physical toll of being a workhorse running back has raised questions about his longevity in the league.</p><h2 id=competition-and-sharing-carries-oClhkUKrMm>Competition and Sharing Carries</h2><p>The emergence of Tony Pollard, another talented running back on the Cowboys’ roster, has led to a reduced workload for Elliott. Pollard’s explosive playmaking ability has given the team another option in the backfield, leading to a timeshare situation where carries and playing time are split between the two backs.</p><h2 id=off-field-issues-oClhkUKrMm>Off-Field Issues</h2><p>Elliott’s career has not been without controversy. He has faced several off-field issues, including a six-game suspension in 2017 for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy. These incidents have sometimes overshadowed his on-field achievements and have led to concerns about his focus and commitment to football.</p><h2 id=statistical-decline-oClhkUKrMm>Statistical Decline</h2><p>Statistically, Elliott’s numbers have seen a decline from his early years in the league. While he remains a productive player, his yards per carry and total rushing yards have decreased, leading to discussions about whether he has already passed his peak performance years.</p><h2 id=team-dynamics-and-offensive-shifts-oClhkUKrMm>Team Dynamics and Offensive Shifts</h2><p>The Cowboys’ offensive strategy has also evolved over time. With quarterback Dak Prescott’s development and a talented group of wide receivers, the team has shifted towards a more pass-heavy approach. This change in offensive philosophy has naturally led to fewer opportunities for Elliott to impact the game as a runner.</p><h2 id=salary-cap-implications-oClhkUKrMm>Salary Cap Implications</h2><p>Elliott’s significant contract has implications for the Cowboys’ salary cap situation. As his performance has leveled off, the value of his contract relative to his production has come under scrutiny. This has led to discussions about the possibility of restructuring his deal or even moving on from the star running back.</p><h2 id=current-status-and-future-prospects-oClhkUKrMm>Current Status and Future Prospects</h2><p>As of now, Elliott remains a key player for the Dallas Cowboys. However, his future with the team and in the NFL is a topic of much speculation. With the physical demands of the running back position and the financial considerations of his contract, Elliott’s career is at a crossroads.</p><h2 id=impact-on-the-cowboys-success-oClhkUKrMm>Impact on the Cowboys’ Success</h2><p>Despite the challenges, Elliott’s presence on the field continues to be important for the Cowboys’ success. His ability to pick up tough yards, pass protect, and serve as a leader in the locker room are valuable assets to the team.</p><h2 id=training-and-conditioning-oClhkUKrMm>Training and Conditioning</h2><p>Elliott has made efforts to adapt to the changing circumstances of his career. He has focused on training and conditioning to maintain his health and performance level. His work ethic and dedication to staying in shape have been praised by coaches and teammates alike.</p><h2 id=leadership-and-mentorship-oClhkUKrMm>Leadership and Mentorship</h2><p>As a veteran on the team, Elliott has also taken on a role as a mentor to younger players. His experience and knowledge of the game are resources that benefit the entire running backs room and the offense as a whole.</p><h2 id=public-perception-and-fan-support-oClhkUKrMm>Public Perception and Fan Support</h2><p>The public perception of Elliott has been mixed due to his on-field performance fluctuations and off-field issues. However, he continues to have a strong base of fan support, with many appreciating his contributions to the team and the community.</p><h2 id=media-coverage-and-analysis-oClhkUKrMm>Media Coverage and Analysis</h2><p>The media’s coverage of Elliott has been extensive, with analysts frequently discussing his performance, contract, and future in the league. His status as a high-profile player ensures that his career developments are closely watched and debated.</p><h2 id=comparison-to-other-nfl-running-backs-oClhkUKrMm>Comparison to Other NFL Running Backs</h2><p>When compared to his peers, Elliott’s career trajectory is not uncommon for NFL running backs. The position is known for having a short peak performance window, and Elliott’s experiences reflect the challenges that many running backs face as they navigate their NFL careers.</p><h2 id=table-ezekiel-elliott-career-overview-oClhkUKrMm>Table: Ezekiel Elliott Career Overview</h2><table><tr><th>Season</th><th>Rushing Yards</th><th>Touchdowns</th><th>Yards Per Carry</th><th>Games Played</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,631</td><td>15</td><td>5.1</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>983</td><td>7</td><td>4.1</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1,434</td><td>6</td><td>4.7</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>1,357</td><td>12</td><td>4.5</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>979</td><td>6</td><td>4.0</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>1,002</td><td>10</td><td>4.2</td><td>17</td></tr></table><h2 id=faq-section-oClhkUKrMm>FAQ Section</h2><h3 id=is-ezekiel-elliott-still-a-starting-running-back-for-the-dallas-cowboys-oClhkUKrMm>Is Ezekiel Elliott still a starting running back for the Dallas Cowboys?</h3><p>Yes, as of the latest information, Ezekiel Elliott is still a starting running back for the Dallas Cowboys, although he shares carries with Tony Pollard.</p><h3 id=has-ezekiel-elliotts-performance-declined-oClhkUKrMm>Has Ezekiel Elliott’s performance declined?</h3><p>Statistically, Elliott’s performance has seen a decline from his early years, which can be attributed to injuries, increased competition for carries, and changes in the Cowboys’ offensive strategy.</p><h3 id=what-is-the-future-outlook-for-ezekiel-elliott-with-the-cowboys-oClhkUKrMm>What is the future outlook for Ezekiel Elliott with the Cowboys?</h3><p>The future outlook for Ezekiel Elliott with the Cowboys is uncertain.
