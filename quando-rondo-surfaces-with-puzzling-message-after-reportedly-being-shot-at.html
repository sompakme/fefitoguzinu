Quando Rondo has stood by his friend Leeks throughout the ordeal and there has been news that Rondo has made&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">questionable statements</a> about King Von since his slaying. Most recently, Rondo and his entourage<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> were reportedly fired upon</a>, leaving one person injured after being shot in the hand. After the news circulated, the rapper sent out a puzzling message to his Instagram Story.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"A n*gga will tell you they love you then stab you in yo," the message on the rapper's Story reads. Of course, after the screenshot went viral, people on various social media platforms have been begging Rondo to finish what looked to be an incomplete thought. Instead, he deleted the post and decided to continue promoting his forthcoming mixtape,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Still Taking Risks.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Rondo sat down with Angela Yee </a>for an extensive interview regarding King Von's death and the backlash he's received. According to Rondo, he never had an issue with Von and stated that he didn't know why there was an altercation between the two crews that fateful evening.&nbsp;"I don't have a clue at all. I never dealt with no female that he dealt with. I never said a curse word to this man," said Rondo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Our last conversation been some cool sh*t, chillin', laughin', tellin' jokes. I never had a problem with them," he added. "That's why I don't understand how can everybody be mad at me? How can everybody be mad at my brother [Timothy Leeks]?"
