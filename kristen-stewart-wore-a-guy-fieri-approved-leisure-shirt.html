After wearing a princess-style Chanel gown with lederhosen-inspired details, she continued her duties as the&nbsp;president of the international jury at the Berlin International Film Festival wearing a leisure shirt that would definitely be something <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>her idol Guy Fieri</a> would wear on his long-running show&nbsp;Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Stewart attended a reception hosted by Berlin's mayor Franziska Giffey to commemorate this year's festival. For the occasion, she ditched her Chanel couture and opted for a more laid-back outfit that included a cream-colored camp-collar shirt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>from Lilysilk</a> and a pair of olive-green pants. She finished with sneakers and wore her hair in a messy mullet style that she debuted at the festival last week. She kept her makeup minimal and did the same for her accessories: all she added was a shimmering crystal choker and a delicate watch.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to spearheading the jury at the film festival this year, Stewart also used her position to bring attention to human rights violations in Iran. She joined Iranian filmmakers and actors on Saturday for a protest in support of the Women, Life, Freedom movement. Though the silent protest focused on what's happening in Iran, demonstrators also mentioned the need to shine a light on climate change and fair wages for Berlin movie theater workers. In addition to Stewart, Berlinale executive director Mariëtte Rissenbeck, artistic director Carlo Chatrian, and jury member and Iranian-American star of&nbsp;The Siren, Golshifteh Farahani, were also in attendance.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the protest, during the festival's opening night celebrations, Farahani&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a>, “This regime lies … executes. The prisons of Iran are full of innocent people. We need you to stand on the right side of history with the Iranian people. This regime will fall.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqugrKyVo3q0wMSwmKusXaGyqr%2FUq5xmq5iev7V5wZ6ppaGeYrOquMxmnZ6rpJ7DoriMcGhuaWRnhg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./indian-baby-born-with-26-fingers-toes-hailed-as-reincarnation-of-hindu-goddess-photos-stun-many.html><span>←</span><span>Indian Baby Born With 26 Fingers &amp;amp; Toes Hailed as Reincarnation of Hindu Goddess, Photos Stun Many</span></a>
