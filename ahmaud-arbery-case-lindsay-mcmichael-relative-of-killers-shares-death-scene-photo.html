The 25-year-old Georgia resident was jogging when he was followed by father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael—now reportedly for four to five minutes around his neighborhood—<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">before they shot and killed him on the road</a>. The McMichaels argued that Ahmaud was a suspect in neighborhood robberies so they went to make a citizen's arrest and he resisted, resulting in his death.</p><p>Sean Rayford / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For months, the McMichaels weren't taken into custody because the District Attorney's office asserted that they were well within the law to make a citizen's arrest, but after the video of the incident leaked online, things began to change. They're currently being held without bail in a Georgia jail, and while they're locked up, their supporters continue to advocate for their release from custody.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not helping the situation is Lindsay McMichael, Travis's sister and Gregory's daughter. She thought it would be a good idea to share&nbsp;a picture to Snapchat showing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ahamud Arbery dead and covered in blood</a>. After being called out, she told&nbsp;The Sun that she didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. “I had no nefarious or malicious intent when I posted that picture,” Lindsay McMichael said. “The thing is I’m a huge fan of true crime — I listen to four or five podcasts a week — I’m constantly watching that sort of thing. It was more of a, ‘Holy s–t, I can’t believe this has happened. It was absolutely poor judgment.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the Arbery family has been made aware of the photo and once again are confronted with visuals of his death scene. “The picture Lindsay McMichael posted was very disturbing and very disturbing to the family,” their attorney, S. Lee Merritt, stated. “It actually fits the pattern of the McMichael family engaging in a weird, violent form of voyeurism.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
