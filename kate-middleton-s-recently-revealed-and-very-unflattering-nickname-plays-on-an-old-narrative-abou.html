Now, this; Scobie alleges her role is one other parents could “only dream of,” and writes that she “does not plan to increase her workload for 10 to 15 years,” until <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-george/>Prince George</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-charlotte/>Princess Charlotte</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-louis-of-cambridge/>Prince Louis</a> are grown. (They are currently 10, eight, and five, respectively.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUAY3uZESiBK7sWsHrKEjP-1920-80.jpg><p>“Where other senior royals are out and about several times a week, meeting people across the length and breadth of the country, Kate has long maintained a smaller work schedule that helped her check off the required royal boxes while saving time for her roles as a mother and wife,” Scobie writes. (In Kate’s defense, anyone who actively follows her knows that she typically makes several appearances each week, as well.)</p><p>Elsewhere in the book, Scobie also brands Kate “cold” and, despite being an advocate for better mental health, Kate “ignored Meghan’s cries for help” and had “no interest in being friends with her sister-in-law," he writes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/moVMvwiXY6P4CAkwj2QLaa-1920-80.jpg><p>Royal experts have spoken out against Scobie’s claims in Endgame, including royal historian Dr. Tessa Dunlop, who said of the book that “Unfortunately no one appears to have briefed Omid, whose muck-raking book covers old ground: William is only in it for the Crown, ‘coachable’ Kate is a mere part-timer, while tawdry rumors of marital discord between the pair make Omid look no better than the tabloids he attacks.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
