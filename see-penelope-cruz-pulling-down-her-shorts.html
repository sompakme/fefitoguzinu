Once again, <a href=#>the shoot</a> is in black and white, allowing Cruz’s natural beauty to take center stage. She also wears a black two-piece combo accentuated with a black leather jacket to add some style to the look.</p><p>Penelope Cruz always knows how to bring the heat on Instagram, and the shots from this photoshoot continue to prove it. It’s definitely enough to get fans excited to see her on the big screen again, as Cruz also knows how to always put forth an incredible performance. Unfortunately, we might have a little while to wait until we can see her next big project.</p><p>Right now, the only film Penelope Cruz has on her docket is the Enzo Ferrari biopic Ferrari, which has yet to announce an official release date. Cruz is set to play Ferrari’s wife Laura, while <a href=#>Adam Driver</a> has been cast in the titular role. The film is set to follow Ferrari’s life and will also star Jack O’Connell, Shailene Woodley, Sarah Gadon, Patrick Dempsey, Valentina Belle, Gabriel Leone, Lino Musella, Erik Haugen, Guiseppe Bonifati, Alex Tonti, and Leonardo Caimi.</p><p>While there’s no release date for the movie yet, it should be well worth the wait. Undoubtedly, the performances from Penelope Cruz and Adam Driver are going to be fantastic, but <a href=#>Ferrari</a> is also Michael Mann’s return to film after 2015’s Blackhat. Mann is always an interesting director and him working with Cruz and Driver is a recipe for a great film.</p><p>Along with being directed by Michael Mann, Mann also co-wrote Ferrari with Troy-Kennedy Martin. Their screenplay is adapted from the book by Brock Yates. The film is listed as in the post-production stages, so hopefully, we’ll be seeing it later this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/penelope-cruz-pirates-of-the-caribbean-900x450.jpg><p>With a prestige film like Ferrari in Penelope Cruz’s future, it wouldn’t be surprising if she nabbed her fifth Oscar nomination for playing Laura Ferrari. Her last nomination was just last year for the film Madres Paralelas (Parallel Mothers in English). Although Cruz has been nominated four times to date, her only win was in 2009 for Vicky Cristina Barcelona.</p><p>While we might have to wait a while to see Penelope Cruz in Ferrari, you may be able to see her 2022 film En los margenes (On the Fringe) on Amazon Prime Video in the near future. The film was released in Spain back in October but has yet to be released to streaming platforms. Hopefully, that will be happening sooner than later.</p><p>If you can’t wait until later this year to catch Penelope Cruz’s next project, you could always revisit her 2022 film The 355, which is available to stream on <a href=#>Amazon Prime Video</a> now. The 355 is a spy thriller about a CIA agent teaming up with three international agents to recover a dangerous top-secret weapon, all while being pursued by a mysterious woman. Along with Penelope Cruz, the film stars Jessica Chastain,&nbsp;Lupita Nyongo,&nbsp;Diane Kruger,&nbsp;Fan Bingbing,&nbsp;Sebastian Stan, and&nbsp;Édgar Ramírez.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnoJq7prjOqZxmm6Kqx2681KWjoqaXYsCpu9GtqmegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./real-madrid-and-barcelona-set-for-titanic-battle-in-copa-del-rey-semifinal.html><span>←</span><span>Real Madrid and Barcelona set for titanic battle in Copa del Rey semifinal</span></a>
