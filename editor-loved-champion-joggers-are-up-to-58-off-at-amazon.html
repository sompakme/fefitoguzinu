So, it’s a special moment when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a pair of sweatpants stands out</a> above the rest — and for me, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Champion’s Powerblend Joggers</a> do just that. In fact, I’ve barely taken them off for the holiday break and even wore them to Christmas dinner (I wish I was kidding). I didn’t think my all-time favorite pair of sweatpants could get any better until I saw that they’re&nbsp; up to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">58% off at Amazon right now</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>their Y2K trendiness</a> — I swore I had sweatpants that looked just like these in middle school — the now-$18 joggers are impossibly soft and cozy. The interior fabric is fluffy and warm, while the outside is smooth and velvety. The fit is slimming but stretchy enough that I don’t feel constricted while wearing them, and the elastic at the ankle is also flexible and doesn’t dig into my skin even after hours of wear.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $18 (Originally $45); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m clearly in good company when it comes to my obsession with these game-changing joggers, as they have <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">more than 18,000 five-star ratings</a> at Amazon alone.&nbsp; I love that they’re stretchy and warm enough for lounging at home, but sleek enough to wear out and about in the neighborhood or to run some quick errands. Many reviewers also commented on their love for the slim fit that lends itself to a “comfy cute” style, according to one person, while still remaining lightweight and non-baggy. Plus, the drawstring waistband allows you to customize the fit to your liking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one reviewer</a> sums up nicely, these joggers are “so soft on the inside, with plenty of give.” And while many sweatpants don’t last forever, a shopper said that after multiple wears, these “aren’t coming apart at the seams after use and washing. The logo is solid and isn’t crusting off.” They added that the pants have “great airflow” and are “warm, but not too much [that] you’ll overheat during a workout.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since prices start at just $18 in the black colorway, you truly can’t go wrong with giving these cozy joggers a whirl (especially with Amazon’s generous return policy). Needless to say, I paid much more for the pair I am currently wearing, but I’m stocking up on more colors of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my favorite Champion joggers while they’re priced this low</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGYpqiZpLtuvM6wnKuanJq7pXnJqJ6gnaJiwLixwK2nmqakqHqiucCzpqdlZ2WGcX%2BTag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-white-facts-singer-s-real-name-wife-children-and-death-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Barry White facts: Singer's real name, wife, children and death explained</span></a>
