Llewellyn strides into Margaret's life at just the right moment, as her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a28430957/princess-margaret-antony-armstrong-jones-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tumultuous marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">tumultuous marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones</a> is falling apart. Though his affairs have long been a relatively open secret, Antony is now seriously involved with another woman, Lucy Lindsay-Hogg (who he will go on to marry in 1978). Margaret is not about to take this deeply hurtful revelation lying down, and she wastes no time in finding herself a younger man who—as several characters do—bears an uncanny resemblance to Antony.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here are a few key facts to know about Llewellyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-4ejr0h emevuu60"><strong>He was 17 years Margaret's junior.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the many eyebrow-raising aspects of Margaret and Llewellyn's relationship, by 1970s standards, was the significant age difference between the pair. When they first met in 1973 Llewellyn was 25, while Margaret was 43. According to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1099594.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BBC class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">BBC</a>, he was considered to be "her most outrageous choice to date … many years younger, footloose and fancy-free. The couple first met in Scotland in September 1973 at the Café Royal in Edinburgh when travelling to a house party in Peebleshire hosted by Margaret's old friend, Colin Tennant."</p><img alt="Princess Margaret and Roddy Llwellyn" title="Princess Margaret and Roddy Llwellyn" width=3569 height=2833 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-margaret-and-her-companion-roddy-llewellyn-on-news-photo-1573778975.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hulton Deutsch</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">His relationship with Margaret was outed by a tabloid.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As depicted in the show, Margaret and Llewellyn's relationship becomes public when a paparazzi photographer follows them on vacation to the West Indies and takes covert photographs of the pair frolicking in the ocean. For Crown aficionados, this moment plays as a callback to the episode of Season 2 in which Margaret and Antony first meet. After agreeing to let Antony photograph her, Margaret persuaded him to send one of the scantily clad pictures to a newspaper, where its publication sparked a minor scandal.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the publication of the photos, in real life, Llewellyn issued <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/princess-margaret-affair-roddy-llewellyn-divorce-antony-armstrong-jones-lord-snowdon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a shamefaced statement" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">a shamefaced statement</a>, writing, "I much regret any embarrassment caused to Her Majesty the Queen and the royal family, for whom I wish to express the greatest respect, admiration and loyalty.

But Llewellyn seems to have given the production his blessing, and he even met with Bonham Carter prior to filming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He came to tea with me and Harry, who plays Roddy," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/helena-bonham-carter-interview-talking-toyboys-and-tiaras-with-the-crowns-princess-margaret-xzqh9fcq9 data-affiliate=true data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bonham Carter told the " class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Bonham Carter told the </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/helena-bonham-carter-interview-talking-toyboys-and-tiaras-with-the-crowns-princess-margaret-xzqh9fcq9 data-affiliate=true data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sunday Times" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Sunday Times</a> before going on to discuss the reasons why Llewellyn had been such a good match for Margaret. "He was so fun and warm—that's what [Margaret] needed. He's very musical. He started singing a song in my kitchen. He said they found each other just at the right time. They were both very lost, both felt somewhat outsiders, just not quite accepted by the family—or not quite good enough. Her confidence was really undermined by the breakdown of her marriage. He also gave her fun at a time when she hadn’t been having much."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">His relationship with Margaret lasted for a long time.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though The Crown depicts their relationship as a relatively brief fling, which seemingly ends in the season finale, in reality, Llewellyn and Margaret dated for eight years, according to the BBC. In a 2002 piece for the now-defunct News of the World newspaper, Llewellyn opened up about his time with the princess.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I didn't think about the consequences of such a high-profile affair," he said, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1384450/I-followed-my-heart-says-Llewellyn.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Telegraph" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Telegraph</a>. "I was just following my heart. […] I discovered a warm and witty woman, possessing a strong sense of duty and dedication to her country's interests, who has honoured me with her friendship since that first house party that was so filled with fun and laughter. […] In Princess Margaret I found a fine friend who could steady my restless nature and offer wise counsel."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">The queen approved of Margaret's relationship with Llewellyn.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the controversy their romance drew, Margaret's sister, Queen Elizabeth II, reportedly gave the couple her blessing—at least tacitly. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/princess-margaret-affair-roddy-llewellyn-divorce-antony-armstrong-jones-lord-snowdon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=History.com class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">History.com</a>, Colin Tennant's wife, Anne Tennant, revealed in a 2018 documentary that the queen approached her at Margaret's funeral in 2002, and said, "I'd just like to say, Anne, it was rather difficult at moments, but I thank you so much for introducing Princess Margaret to Roddy 'cause he made her really happy."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
