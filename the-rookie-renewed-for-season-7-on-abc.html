ABC has renewed its drama series The Rookie for a seventh season in 2024-25. The police procedural starring Nathan Fillion — which passed the 100-episode mark earlier this season — continues to draw decent-sized audiences for the network, even as it has outlived its title. The Rookie is so named because at the show’s outset, Fillion’s John Nolan is the oldest rookie in the Los Angeles Police Department."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Six seasons in, Nolan’s rookie status is long gone, but he “has used his life experience, determination and sense of humor to keep up with rookies 20 years his junior,” as ABC puts it in the season six logline. Mekia Cox, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T.
