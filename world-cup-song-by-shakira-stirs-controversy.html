Every FIFA World Cup comes with an official FIFA World Cup song — from ‘La Copa de la Vida’ by Ricky Martin at France 1998 to ‘Gloryland’ by Daryl Hall (no Oates) at USA 1994."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This year’s song, “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” however, has stirred sentiment among South Africans, many of whom were outraged because <span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps>FIFA</span></span></span></span></span></span> selected a non-African, Colombian pop star Shakira, to write the song and perform lead vocals.</p><p></p><p>Based on <a href=#>a Cameroonian marching chant</a> and featuring backup by popular South African group <a href=#>Freshlyground</a>, “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)” has many soccer fans around the world dancing to an African beat. And when Shakira takes the stage Thursday night in Soweto’s Orlando Stadium for <a href=#><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps>FIFA</span></span></span></span></span></span>’s kick-off concert</a>, she’ll be joined by American music stars John Legend, Alicia Keys and the Black Eyed Peas.</p><p>But in <a href=#>calls to local talk shows</a>, <a href=#>interviews with the press</a> and <a href=#>meetings with <span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps><span class=caps>FIFA</span></span></span></span></span></span> officials</a>, South Africans demanded to know why an African wasn’t chosen for the high-profile role. The South African artist’s union proclaimed that the concert was “not an African event” and <a href=#>had called for a boycott</a>.</p><p><span class=caps>FIFA</span> eventually expanded the number of African acts, with the final roster now including the Soweto Gospel Choir, trumpeter <a href=#>Hugh Masekela</a> and Somali hip-hop star <a href=#>K’naan</a>.</p><p>Freshlyground, which was originally scheduled to perform as Shakira’s backup band, was also given its own slot. But the band itself doesn’t feel slighted by <span class=caps>FIFA</span> or its decision to choose Shakira for the official World Cup song, says Freshlyground violinist Kyla-Rose Smith.</p><p>“I think that the World Cup is a global event but it’s also a business, a huge marketing exercise,” Smith says. “<span class=caps>FIFA</span> requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the different kinds of people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup. So I understand the choice of someone like Shakira.”</p><p>Calling itself “the musical voice of a nation’s adolescent democracy,” Freshlyground mixes black, white, male and female talent behind the lead vocals of Zolani Mahola. For eight years, they have been gaining international traction with singles like “I’d Like” and the more recent “Pot Belly.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>With three albums and a string of international tours under their belt, Freshlyground’s musicians traveled to New York in February to record their latest record, “Radio Africa.” That’s where they ran into Shakira, who was developing “Waka Waka” in the same studio.</p><p>Shakira’s song needed a few more African touches, so her producer asked Freshlyground to lend a hand.</p><p>“We are a band that is very much influenced by African music. We use those sounds and styles a lot. So we just added what we do, really,” says Smith.</p><p><b>Listen to Kyla-Rose Smith tell the story:</b></p><p>Shakira and Freshlyground will come together for an encore performance of “Waka Waka” before the World Cup Finals on July 11 in Johannesburg’s Soccer City Stadium.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2Bjsri%2Fx6isq2eRp8G0e9aoqaWcXZjCsXnSqKWgZZKuerS0wKSgq5ldqMGqvtJmmqimpKe8t7HRrLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-words-have-gon-in-them.html><span>←</span><span>What words have gon in them?</span></a>
