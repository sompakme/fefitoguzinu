As Monsters and Critics recently reported, the 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way star announced that she and her husband, Brandan DeNuccio, are expecting their second child together.
Although this should be a happy time in Mary’s life, the reality TV star is feeling down in the dumps, perhaps due to fluctuating pregnancy hormones.
