Known as curtain bangs' equally chic and shaggy younger sister — just a bit more choppy — this variety of fringe has picked up steam among It girls and those interested in refreshing their look (but without all the effort). Stylish, practical, and universally flattering, bottleneck bangs are one of the most requested styles this season. To find out more, we tapped stylists to get the DL on the trending cut, from styling advice to maintenance tips, and everything in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling to learn everything there is to know about bottleneck bangs and see whether they're right for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-bottleneck-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Bottleneck Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The term was coined by London-based hairstylist and international creative color director for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Evo Hair</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Tom Smith</a>. "Bottleneck bangs are the ultimate 70's inspired, super flattering, face-framing, cutting technique that can be adjusted to suit almost any face shape," he says. "This hairstyle takes inspiration from the neck of a bottle, starting slim and short in the middle, curving longer around the eyes, and then longest following the line of the cheekbone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith recommends asking your stylist to create longer bangs that skim your cheekbones at an angle that flatters your face and sits somewhere between the cheekbones and jaw. "Then ask for the central part to be cut shorter, keeping the cutting line soft and choppy, with the shortest part in the middle and getting longer on the edges," he says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-style></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Style</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nick Stenson</a>, a celebrity hairstylist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Matrix</a> artistic director, recommends purposely creating a laid-back style using nothing more than a flat brush and a spritz of a dry texturizing spray. "Spray <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Matrix Miss Mess Dry Finishing Spray</a> in the roots and ends to create a day-two effect and keep the hair from appearing overly polished," he says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-theyre-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who They're For</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of the low-styling effort, another plus of bottleneck bangs is that they truly work for everyone. So, if you have been reluctant to try bangs for fear of how they frame your face, rest assured you can customize bottleneck bangs to suit your features and preferences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Many people don't suit a classic fringe, but most can wear bottleneck bangs to add softness to the face," says Smith. "You can adjust the length and angle depending on whether you want to make your cheekbones appear wider or stronger, or maybe you'd prefer to slim and narrow a wider face, drawing focus to your eyes and lips."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another plus? They are also very versatile and work with different hair lengths. "Bottleneck bangs will pair very well with long or short hair and tends to look good on all straight, wavy, and curly textures," says Stenson. Smith agrees, "The asymmetrical shape makes for much more variety when it comes to styling, and you can accompany them with face-framing feathered layers, soft waves, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shaggy 70's style haircut</a>, or left hanging out for a cheeky up-do look."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, if you're someone who's looking to add a bit of texture to your hair and edge to your look, then consider bottleneck bangs for your next hairstyle. However, before heading to the salon, make sure to bring some pictures to give your stylist a visual of what you want. "With every trending haircut, there will always be customized variations that make them work for different individuals," says Stenson. "Be sure to bring images to your appointment that demonstrate the examples of bottleneck bangs that inspired you to make this change."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-21ce21b2-846d-411e-a671-b446162a647f></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=43.265993265993><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-0.81818181818182><p><span class=accordion__title>What's the difference between bottleneck bangs and curtain bangs?</span></p><p>"Curtain bangs generally fall away from the face in a soft way," says Stenson.
