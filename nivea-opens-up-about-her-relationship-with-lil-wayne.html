And, apparently, it had to do with <a href=#>Lil Wayne</a>. According to Nivea, Lil Wayne reached out to her label for a collaboration, after seeing her video for <a href=#>"Don't Mess With My Man"</a>&nbsp;... but he had something else in mind. "He said, 'I don't want to work with you, I just want your number,'" Nivea explained. Pretty soon, the two started dating, and Lil Wayne convinced her to move to New Orleans. "And then he said, 'Come be with me, I got you.'"</p><p dir=ltr>However, things didn't go as planned, as Lil Wayne soon married Toya Johnson. "I'm just sitting there, like, being a housewife," Nivea continued. "All of a sudden he was like, 'I ain't never stay in an apartment before. Let's get an apartment.' So we move out the house and get an apartment but I never realized he did that to move Toya back in the house."</p><p>Despite all the messiness, however, Nivea and Toya remained cordial, as her recent comment under the interview shows. "Great interview. So proud of you," Toya wrote on Instagram (via <a href=#>The Shade Room</a>). Lauren London, who also shares a child with Wayne, showed her support as well. "Love you . You are pure magic and strength," she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1paoV4e82irZ6ZXaS9prrSZqypZZGXvLbAjKGcq2WimrmiwMiopaygmaV6uLXToWSloZxixKLFzZ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-buffett-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Buffett Net Worth 2024</span></a>
