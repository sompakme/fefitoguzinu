Speaking about the situation, Andrew said that it was "disappointing and depressing to receive quite such a beating" over the album.</p><p id=ewAqOJaERBe data-wc=82>Following the album's release, Andrew remained out of the public spotlight, reappearing very rarely for some events, including a concert with George in Rio de Janeiro, the BBC Two show Fantasy Football League, and a 2005 documentary about George. He told The Big Issue: "I didn't have any real ambitions to do anything else in music," he said. "I didn't have any artistic destiny like Yog. I had a girlfriend and we had a really rather nice couple of years in LA."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dbddf8318990-andrew-ridgeley-z.jpg><p id=eaosX5kfcca data-wc=24>Eagle-eyed fans might have spotted that Andrew also made a cameo appearance in the Christmas rom-com starring Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47c4d57e1656-andrew-ridgeley1-a.jpg><p id=eq-kpmqsMls data-wc=43>Speaking about making the documentary, Andrew told NME: "The nice thing about Wham! is that it was almost exclusively a joyful and positive period in both our lives.

Speaking to The Sunday Mirror about how they initially split before reconciling in 2015, Andrew explained: "We split up but we are through those difficulties now and it is all ancient history. It's safe to say that things are good and we are very happy now. I don't really like to talk about my private life much but we have worked through everything." After their split, Andrew said: "We retain a great affection for one another."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fc17c3c45409-whamn00051817.jpg><p id=exynwseny54 data-wc=21>Andrew has since been in a relationship with influencer Amanda Cronin, with the pair stepping out together at Wimbledon in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24e2a5e489d3-andrew-ridgeley-george-michael-a.jpg><h3>What is the WHAM!
