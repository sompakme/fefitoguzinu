She eventually signed with 20th Century-Fox and made her debut with the drama Ten Days in Paris (1940). She appeared in many films throughout the early 1940s, including Kings Row (1942) and All Through the Night (1942). She married Peter Lorre in 1945, but the union was brief and they divorced in 1952. She attempted suicide multiple times during the course of the marriage. After their divorce, she made herself available for films but her career had already been affected. She found some sporadic TV work but they were minor and few and far between. Her last movie role was in Ship of Fools (1965). Kaaren died suddenly in her Hollywood home during Christmas week in 1967, and the cause of death is unknown. She was survived by her third husband and an adopted daughter.<br><b>Kaaren Verne is a member of <a href=#>Actress</a></b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeblq6zsc1mrZ6qnpp6r7HTZq6oqqSdeneClGxs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grand-hotel-fasano-review-lake-garda.html><span>←</span><span>Grand Hotel Fasano Review, Lake Garda</span></a>
