History started back in 2020 when the two would put out their first collaboration project, King's Disease. Just a year later, the second installment in the series would be released.

However, what came next was a little surprising. Any rational thinker would assume that the next effort would be a third King's Disease. Alas, it was not, but instead the duo would begin a new series.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That would be the Magic titles, starting off in 2021 as well. It came out on Christmas Eve as a little gift for all of Nas' fans. After tons of hard work and even putting out some other versions of classic albums. Nas and Hit-boy would take about a year and a half off. 2023 might be the most impressive part of this run because they went on to unleash three projects in the span of six months.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-atlanta-artist-depicts-nas-as-michael-jordan-look>Atlanta Artist Depicts Nas As <a href=# class=text-word>Michael Jordan</a>: Look</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The last two Magic LPs</a> and the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">final King's Disease</a> effort were out well before the end of the year. Magic 3 is getting a lot of praise already and it is no mistake. In fact, all of these have been so celebrated, that one artist in Atlanta painted a picture of Nas, comparing him to another great's run of winning. Michael Jordan's two three-peats in the 90s are widely acknowledged in the sports world as being possibly the greatest achievement by any athlete. HipHopDx found the painter's Instagram. His name is Jerell Gnatt and he recreated Jordan posing with his six rings, but put Nas with his six album covers on his fist. Hit-Boy also approved of the artwork in the comments.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on Nas and Hit-Boy's album being comparable to Michael Jordan's run in the NBA Finals?
