Overall, most fans know him as Carlton from <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air</a>. As Ribeiro states, he was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">typecast for the majority of his career</a>. Numerous casting directors would try to get him into roles that were identical to Carlton's. Although outsiders may think these are great opportunities, for an actor, they are insulting. Ribeiro knew he could do other roles, but they simply were not being offered.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the aftermath of his most recent comments about his career, Ribeiro has been hit with lots of unsolicited advice. Recently, on Twitter, one fan came out and claimed that Ribeiro's career could be revitalized by Tyler Perry. However, Ribeiro did not like that suggestion one bit. In fact, he replied to the fan's comment, saying "I don't need or ever want that man to do anything for me." Overall, it was a pretty sternly worded reply, and fans were curious as to whether or not there was some sort of animosity at play.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-alfonso-ribeiro-speaks-out>Alfonso Ribeiro Speaks Out</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the replies over at The Shade Room, there were numerous calls for Ribeiro to sit down with Shannon Sharpe on Club Shay Shay. Of course, this would be an incredible conversation. Sharpe is known for having great interviews, even if it is the guest who mostly makes it work. If Ribeiro were to go on Club Shay Shay and put it all out there, it would most certainly go viral. That said, it remains to be seen whether or not Ribeiro would even be interested in such a thing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about all of this, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that Ribeiro should go on Club Shay Shay? Do you believe that Shannon Sharpe would be able to get a good interview considering the subject matter?
