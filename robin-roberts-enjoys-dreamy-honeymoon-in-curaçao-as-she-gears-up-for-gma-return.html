They first crossed paths in 2005, set up on a blind date. What followed was a nearly two-decade-long relationship, although their romance remained a well-kept secret until 2013.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLtY1Eui474 data-wc=66>The anticipation of their wedding was heightened when Robin jubilantly announced her engagement to Amber on GMA earlier this year. "OK, I'm saying yes to marriage!" she exclaimed, sharing her excitement with her colleagues. She added, “It’s something we had talked about, but we put it off. She became ill, but it was just – and it is saying yes to that and that next chapter.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2169237e2b58-snapinstaapp3762390113058640854724399123901073149105812n1024.jpg><p id=e5L1_VmAaKj data-wc=37>Their bond is fortified by shared experiences and challenges, as both Robin and Amber have braved breast cancer.

An added treat for the viewers was an inside look into Robin and Amber's wedding dress fittings, providing a sneak peek into their big day's fashion.</p><p id=ecILPWB1jO1 data-wc=49>Choosing to keep some traditions alive, the couple opted for the classic suspense of not revealing their final wedding looks to each other until the day itself. "I want us to see each other in the final dress for the first time on the wedding," Robin shared with Amber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e45d823086c6-robin-roberts-amber-laign-gma-shower.jpg><p id=eIDZ2F-Mm_l data-wc=28>Their nuptials, held on Wednesday, September 8, were a testament to love and intimacy.
