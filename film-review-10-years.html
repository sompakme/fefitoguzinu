More bittersweet than funny but not a downer overall, the pic has reasonable prospects with young viewers who haven’t seen many of its thematic ancestors.</p><p>While Linden’s script spreads the subplots around heavily, the movie’s main identification is with Jake (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_channing-tatum data-tag=channing-tatum>Channing Tatum</a></strong>, who just so happens to be a producer), who loves girlfriend Jess (Tatum’s wife, <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_jenna-dewan data-tag=jenna-dewan>Jenna Dewan</a>-Tatum</strong>) but can’t decide when to pop the question. Bringing Jess along to his ten-year reunion, he’s flustered to see high school sweetheart Mary (<strong>Rosario Dawson</strong>) and the husband (<strong>Ron Livingston</strong>) he didn’t know she had.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">Reunion-centered ensemble pic isn't as funny as advertised, but happily avoids full-on sappiness too.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>PHOTOS: Channing Tatum Stars at ’21 Jump Street’ Premiere</strong></a></p><p>Buzzing around Jake in a flurry of “so good to see you!”s are old classmates who became rock stars (<strong>Oscar Isaac</strong>), moved to the big city (<strong>Justin Long</strong>), or simply decided to grow up and stop bullying nerds (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_chris-pratt data-tag=chris-pratt>Chris Pratt</a></strong>, helped by unusually tolerant wife <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_ari-graynor data-tag=ari-graynor>Ari Graynor</a></strong>). As usual with a large ensemble, recounting the subplots (and even the characters) would take a while, but only a couple of key cast members get lost in the shuffle (sorry, <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_anthony-mackie data-tag=anthony-mackie>Anthony Mackie</a></strong>).</p><p>Among the more successful throughlines is a second-chance courtship between Isaac’s rock star and the only girl at the reunion (<strong>Kate Mara</strong>) who isn’t fawning over him, and, it turns out, has never even heard his hit song. Among the least pleasing is one in which Pratt tries to make amends with every nerd he ever belittled, winds up making them deeply uncomfortable, and eventually drinks himself into a full reversion to jerk mode. If anybody could keep this ball rolling, it’s Pratt, who in previous roles has trained viewers to love him despite many faults. Though we’re with Pratt for a while, Linden soon forces him to be more of a boor than we can take.</p><p>It wouldn’t be a party without some drunken unpleasantness, of course. And 10 Years benefits from actors (like Dawson) who can generate enough distractingly warm-hearted vibes to keep the overall mood positive. This isn’t a new generation’s Big Chill and doesn’t try to be — but it’s a good deal more genuine-feeling than American Reunion, whose characters graduated just a couple of years earlier than this crew but seem much closer to settling into dull adulthood.</p><p>Production Companies: Temple Hill, Iron Horse</p><p>Cast: Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Chris Pratt, Rosario Dawson, Justin Long, Oscar Isaac, Kate Mara, Ron Livingston, Lynn Collins, Ari Graynor, Anthony Mackie, Max Minghella, Aubrey Plaza, Scott Porter, Brian Geraghty , Aaron Yoo, Eiko Nijo, Nick Zano</p><p>Director-Screenwriter: Jamie Linden</p><p>Producers: Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, Reid Carolin, Channing Tatum</p><p>Executive producers: Frank Mancuso, Jr., Eric Gores</p><p>Director of photography: Steven Fierberg</p><p>Production designer: Kara Lindstrom</p><p>Music: Chad Fischer</p><p>Costume designer: Trayce Gigi Field</p><p>Editor: Jake Pushinsky</p><p>PG-13, 100 minutes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2FjmpnZrGVlr%2B0ecKhmKemmaO0bsDAraymZZqau6%2BtjJ2csJmeYreiucieZKWhnpmyr3mSb29pb2Jk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-ratajkowski-surprises-with-unseen-baby-bump-photos-and-just-wow.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Ratajkowski surprises with unseen baby bump photos and just wow</span></a>
