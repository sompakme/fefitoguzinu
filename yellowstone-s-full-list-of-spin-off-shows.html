The drama starred Tim McGraw and Faith Hill and James and Margaret Dutton, and Isabel May as their daughter, Elsa. The show was a limited series meaning that there are no plans for a second instalment. Not yet anyway…&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The trailer for the 1883 season one finale teases Elsa's fate</figure><h3>1923&nbsp;</h3><p id=ebrRFd_QUqd data-wc=65>Similarly, 1923 takes another generation of the Dutton family, this time set during the Great Depression and stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as Jacob and Cara Dutton respectively, while Brandon Sklenar plays Spencer. In the Dutton family tree, Jacob is the great-great uncle of John Dutton (<a class=hm-link href=#>Kevin Costner</a>). The show will run for two seasons, with season two tipped to be released in 2024.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">WATCH PARAMOUNT+ HERE</a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8e8dcb18f9d7-1923-d.jpg><h3>6666</h3><p id=eZsYQwmKAq3B data-wc=68>This is a tricky one. Despite being announced way back in February 2021, there have been very few updates on the production of the planned spin-off, set to be based on the real 6666 ranch in Texas. The show’s creator, Taylor Sheridan, has been hugely busy with a plethora of projects - alongside the WAG strike - so we’re looking forward to an update one of these days!&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Yellowstone's Cole Hauser (aka Rip Wheeler) causes a stir with his coffee brand: Here's how to shop his cowboy coffee" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c1ca62ae064d-cole-hauser-gorgeous-photo-horse.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Yellowstone's Cole Hauser (aka Rip Wheeler) causes a stir with his coffee brand: Here's how to shop his cowboy coffee" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Yellowstone's Cole Hauser (aka Rip Wheeler) causes a stir with his coffee brand: Here's how to shop his cowboy coffee</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Yellowstone, One Chicago, NCIS, among shows facing major setback after 'disappointing' SAG-AFTRA update" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/af006a8be2ba-tv-fall2024.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Yellowstone, One Chicago, NCIS, among shows facing major setback after 'disappointing' SAG-AFTRA update" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Yellowstone, One Chicago, NCIS, among shows facing major setback after 'disappointing' SAG-AFTRA update</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ek8Mh67WTkV2 data-wc=103>In the meantime, the official synopsis reads: "Founded when Comanches still ruled West Texas, no ranch in America is more steeped in the history of the West than the 6666. Still operating as it did two centuries before, and encompassing an entire county, the 6666 has inspired a new scripted series where the rule of law and the laws of nature merge in a place where the most dangerous thing one does is the next thing. The 6666 is synonymous with the merciless endeavor to raise the finest horses and livestock in the world, and ultimately where world-class cowboys are born and made."</p><h3>1944</h3><p id=eMjPkV9DV6EV data-wc=85>1944 is the planned follow-up to 1923 - but the show is still in the early stages of production. Chatting about what to expect, the executive vice president of production at 101 Studios, Tom Prince, said: "Of course, we've got 1923, we've got the sequel, we're not letting the cat out of the bag, it's going to be called '1944’. My guess is that it’ll be shooting largely in the Bitterroot Valley because it has to take place at what is Chief Joseph Ranch."
