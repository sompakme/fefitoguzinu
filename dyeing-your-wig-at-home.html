So she flew from Toronto to New York City, where she met with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hadiiya Barbel</a>, an Emmy award-winning stylist who has worked with celebs like Wendy Williams, Iman, Ashanti, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She made me my first wig," says Thomas. Afterwards, the Toronto native became obsessed with the craftsmanship of her new 'do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the next few years, Thomas was tutored by Barbel, and learned how to make her own wigs for herself and other clients. "I love color, so I started experimenting more," shares Thomas. "I wanted to go beyond the boundaries of coloring hair, and wigs helped with that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a true art to coloring hair — wigs included. But if you can't get in touch with a celebrity stylist, follow Thomas' top tips that she shared with us, instead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-tools-do-i-need-to-dye-my-wig></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Tools Do I Need to Dye My Wig?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, make sure you grab a couple garbage bags to protect your floors and counters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best places to work are on a clean flat counter or a hard surface floor, like in the bathroom or kitchen," the stylist suggests. "You want to avoid carpet, walls and furniture."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You also want to make sure you have a styrofoam wig stand and T-pins to secure the wig in place. Next, grab bowls and brushes for color mixing and application, foil (if you plan on doing highlights), and clips and combs to separate the hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the color you're going for, you may also need some of your favorite bleach (Thomas likes <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Wella's Blondor Multi Blonde Powder Lightener</a>), peroxide (20 volume is safe), and your chosen color. Then you're ready to go!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-method-to-follow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Method to Follow?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can follow the directions on your box of color, or you can try to follow along on YouTube if you're feeling ambitious — it's all up to you!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you watch YouTube videos on coloring techniques, be sure to watch more than one from each stylist to be sure they consistently get their desired results," advises Thomas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Thomas does offer up some of her own personal suggestions, and you should definitely keep them in mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Blonde wigs can be dyed one color with ease if you're using the water color method," she explains. "This procedure is where the wig is immersed in a hot water bath with your favorite bright color."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Box dyes are best for when you want to lift the hair one or two shades lighter," she continues. "If your desired color is in the blond, vibrant red, or copper family, a combination of bleach and tube colors would be advised. And don't forget your toners and purple shampoo to complete [and maintain] your final look." The stylist likes the paraben and sulfate-free cleansers and conditions from Verb.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"These are more gentle on the wig and will keep your wig and its color looking great," said Thomas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to remember that only virgin hair can be colored. And once you dye your wig, you can't use a lighter shade to change the tone. That's why Thomas recommends doing a strand test before diving into any new color to be sure of the results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Box Dye Your Hair at Home</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-else-should-i-keep-in-mind-when-coloring-my-wig-at-home></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Else Should I Keep in Mind When Coloring My Wig at Home?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are few details to keep front of mind when dyeing your own wig at home, according to Thomas:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Never use heat to process your color.</li><li>Make sure to time your color process.</li><li>Seek professional help if the desired look you're going for is complex.</li><li>Don't dye without doing a strand test first.</li><li>Make sure to do conditioning treatments and trim your wig if the ends are damaged.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYpMRuwM5mm7KdXZZ6uLXG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cody-rhodes-fires-back-at-fan-s-homophobic-tweet-about-sonny-kiss.html><span>←</span><span>Cody Rhodes Fires Back At Fans Homophobic Tweet About Sonny Kiss</span></a>
