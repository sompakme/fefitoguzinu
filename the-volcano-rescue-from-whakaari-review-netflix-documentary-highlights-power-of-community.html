There’s nothing more powerful than the connection of people.
That’s the feeling I got after watching the Netflix documentary on the 2019 White Island/Whakaari eruption that claimed the lives of 22 people.
The sobering hour-and-a-half-long film takes viewers from the safety of their living rooms to the unparalleled destructive power of Mother Nature through survivors’ and rescuers’ accounts with minute-by-minute footage.
