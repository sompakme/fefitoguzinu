The company just dropped a t-shirt in support of trans people that CM Punk is proudly wearing.</p><p>Since AEW Collision’s inception, CM Punk has been the central figure of the Saturday night show. His return on June 17th marked a big moment for the show. His name still carries a lot of weight, and now that name value is going to support a worthwhile cause.</p><p>CM Punk and Ricky Starks had a showdown for Punk’s ‘Real’ AEW World Championship during the recent Saturday episode. Punk won that match, and he was also representing the trans community at the same time.</p><p>During his entrance, Punk sported a revamped version of his Best in the World shirt, proudly displaying the Transgender flag. This choice aligns with Punk’s well-known advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. AEW has taken steps to support this cause by releasing the shirt for a limited duration.</p><p>The shirt is currently up for purchase on ShopAEW.com, with the entirety of the proceeds being directed towards the Trevor Project. <a href=#>You can check out the link here to grab one of your own.</a></p><p>This subject means a lot to CM Punk, and he is proud to help out.
