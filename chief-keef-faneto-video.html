The track was arguably Keef's biggest since "I Don't Like," and it remained popular well into 2015, though it's unclear why it took Sosa this long to release the video. In fact, it's unclear if Keef is still actively making music, as earlier this month, he seemingly confirmed to his fans that he had <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">retired</a>. &nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In any case, the video is a reminder of just how huge of a song "Faneto" was, and hopefully it'll inspire fans to encourage Keef to get back in the studio. "I'm a gorilla in a fuckin' coupe, finna pull up to the zoo, n*gga," raps Keef, as his face morphs into that of a gorilla. The video then switches between violent wildlife scenes and shots of Keef sitting in a throne rolling king-sized joints. It's a warm welcome into the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Chicago Zoo</a>."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month, Keef released the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">video</a>&nbsp;to "Superheroes," his collaboration with A$AP Rocky that landed on last year's <strong>Bang 3&nbsp;</strong>album. The "Superheroes" vid had been previewed all the way back in August 2014, so it appears that Keef is sitting on some long overdue work that he's finally been able to let loose now that he has a little more free time on his hands.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdlZYZ5go9mmqGhlZt6rLHEn2SfmZ6awbB51aKbnqddo7K4edWim56n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-senate-recalls-suspended-senator-abdul-ningi-details-emerge.html><span>←</span><span>BREAKING: Senate Recalls Suspended Senator Abdul Ningi, Details Emerge</span></a>
