"Fun Fact: When I was a teen I dreamed of being signed to Def Jam.. every cd I owned, every group, rapper or singer I played in my car was majority Def Jam artist. From that point I set my intentions. And with my Mom-Manager by my side at 18 I signed my first record deal to be&nbsp;@islanddefjam’s 1st 'urban pop' artist. It was a dream come true." While the story is certainly inspiring, many of her fans&nbsp;could&nbsp;only focus on how unreal she looked.</p><p>Sarah Morris/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Damn! Did u even have a baby?!!!! Lol," one of her followers exclaimed.</a>&nbsp;"The snap back,"&nbsp;another wrote in the comments.&nbsp;"How much weight have you lost already? You look amazing,"&nbsp;asked another user.&nbsp;A few weeks ago, Christina opened up about her struggles not only with looking like her pre-baby self again, but also with regaining her confidence.&nbsp;On yet another Fashion Nova-sponsored post, Christina wrote, "OK here it goes… Three weeks post pregnancy and I’m feeling better everyday."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"In the beginning I was kind of worried because my body after baby was retaining SO MUCH water—I’d look in the mirror and be like 'wtf I look like Spongebob'" she joked. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I’d also enjoyed my [pregnancy] body so much</a>. I missed it and felt I looked better when I was pregnant for sure.. However I tried not to let those thoughts get the best of me and had to accredit myself for the 9 months of making an actual human! And with faith, hydration, breast feeding and not being so damn sprung on looks—my confidence is gained day by day."</p><p>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She&nbsp;also made sure to give a shoutout to her man, "who has been my ride or die through this & shows me so much love and appreciation…Honestly I couldn’t have asked for a better partner to experience this with. His support has gotten me through the drab days. U da best!<br>I’m gonna wrap this up.. sending big love to all you women out there. You’re all incredible beings that are capable of anything! Know this. Love you. Keep loving yourself. And [props] to the men/partners that support them."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Staff Writer&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Originally from Vancouver, Lynn Sharpe is a Montreal-based writer for HNHH.
