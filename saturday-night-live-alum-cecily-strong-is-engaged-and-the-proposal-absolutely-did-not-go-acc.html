Look at this,’” Strong told Meyers. “And he showed me his phone, and the first text was from a friend and it said, ‘How did it go? *Ring emoji.*’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttmBjdBLXCmfKvwaGsz7ph-1920-80.jpg><p>Strong continued, “And then I was like, ‘Oh, oh no, should I?’ and he went, ‘Did you see that?’ and I was like, ‘I could try very hard to lie but’—so then I knew.”</p><p>She then told him “I was like, ‘Whenever you want to do it, that’ll be the surprise,’” Strong said. “And then I had kind of a rough night in December, and I was like, ‘Can I just wear the damn ring now?’ And so that’s how we got engaged.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YNJeXLmyeLGjujCgdwTsvi-1920-80.jpg><p>And that’s not where the hiccups stopped: “I don’t know my ring size—I wear, like, every size ring,” Strong said. “So, he took one of those, and it was five sizes too big. I was wearing it on my index finger for a long time—not as a statement, it just would’ve fallen off.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
