According to <a href=#>The Reporter</a>, Carlin released 23 comedy albums, three books, appeared in "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," and voiced the character Fillmore in Disney and Pixar's animated film "Cars." He won a total of four Grammys for his comedy albums and five Emmys for television appearances. He was also posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.</p><p>Carlin's polarizing career in comedy is all discussed in the 2022 documentary series from fans and fellow comedic figures Judd Apatow and&nbsp;Michael Bonfiglio titled "George Carlin's American Dream." Carlin's daughter Kelly Carlin served as a co-executive producer as well. Comedians from all walks of life have explained Carlin's influence, but he influenced American culture overall. Per the <a href=#>New York Daily News</a>, Bonfiglio stated that the conversations all the way up to the Supreme Court showed that Carlin's comedy "created a new category of speech in our country." Perhaps it pays to speak one's mind as Carlin so frequently did. Maybe if Carlin had existed in today's world, his success would not be the same, but he'd surely find a way to incorporate his commentary into the modern sociopolitical landscape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkmxoaWpfrLWiwIywmKxll5q8s7PEZpqaqpyeu7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpedahnKdlmJp6pbXEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-prince-really-thought-of-the-kardashians.html><span>←</span><span>What Prince Really Thought Of The Kardashians</span></a>
