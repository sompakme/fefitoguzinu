Which of course included the iconic gingerbread houses.</p><p>Alongside the traditional family house, which has the names of Kim and all four kids, we see a number of smaller buildings. Let us tell you, the attention to detail has not been missed.</p><p>The gingerbread people need to be kept warm, right? Well, fear not, Kim and North have placed tiny fake fireplaces inside the gingerbread houses, so they can stay nice and toasty while waiting for Santa. In fact, Santa’s already waiting for them inside in one of the homes.</p><p>Of course, the fireplaces aren’t made from real fire. The lights look like they’re made from tiny LED lights. Whatever they’re made from, they look good, and that’s all that matters, right?</p><p>The gingerbread mansions aren’t the only famous tradition the Kardashians have, the annual Christmas Eve Party is arguably the biggest party in Calabasas. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the party hasn’t been out in full force for the past two years, so we can’t wait to see how they make up for the holidays.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gingerbread-isn-t-just-for-christmas>Gingerbread isn’t just for Christmas</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Travis ❤️ Kourtney (@kravis_love)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>Although regular folk like you and I associate gingerbread with Christmas time, of course, The Kardashians go the extra mile and use gingerbread to celebrate all occasions, and why shouldn’t they?</p><p>This Halloween, oldest sister <a href=#>Kourtney</a> was the one organizing the Halloween gingerbread houses with her new husband Travis Barker.</p><p>And if Halloween and Christmas weren’t enough, the Kardashians also utilized the gingerbread houses on Valentine’s Day this year!</p><p>But where do the reality stars source the iconic houses from?
