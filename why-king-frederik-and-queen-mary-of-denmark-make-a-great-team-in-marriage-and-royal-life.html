"Gemini's chief requirement in relationship is a meeting of minds and this is what makes him compatible with Queen Mary, an Aquarius and fellow Air sign.</p><p id=eHWHuq9Wh43 data-wc=44>"The Air elements need friendship as the basis for a compatible partnership, things to talk about, explore and discover together. Both Gemini and Aquarius enjoy meeting people, connecting and communicating. <strong>This marriage is a professional working relationship and neither of them are romantic idealists.</strong></p><p id=eXnJq4JTJHv data-wc=25>"<strong>Whatever distracted her Gemini husband, they are bound together with his love planet Venus exactly on her Saturn. It is their karma to be together.</strong>"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0fcdef1c08a8-queen-margrethe-told-frederik-three-days-before.jpg><p id=eNQdllljHVQ data-wc=34>Debbie also explained what attracted Frederik to Mary in the first place. The couple <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>famously met at a bar in Sydney</a> during the 2000 Olympic Games, and the rest is, as they say, history.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezZqEOyK_Wj data-wc=29>"Queen Mary, brought up in Tasmania, is literally a breath of fresh Aquarian air. She exudes the Aquarian ease at getting on with people and is already hugely popular. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p id=eRbwiU2xslJ data-wc=58>"Aquarians are innovative, wanting to bring about change, and she is perfectly placed to be an initiator of new programmes which capture public interest. Her crowning glory is her Moon in harmonious Libra placed close to effervescent Uranus, giving her great personal magnetism. <strong>This is what attracted the then Prince Fredrik and will always surprise and intrigue him.</strong>"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Queen Mary seen behind-the-scenes as Frederik is proclaimed King:</figure><p id=eOS3pBSQ9KN data-wc=55>Now that he has the "top job," it seems King Frederik will fully be in his element, Debbie also argued. "He was born on a New Moon in Gemini close to Mars, giving him a laser-like mind, needing constant mental stimulation. Now in the 'top job', he's going to thrive on the busyness and engagement."</p><p id=elEPtcpSJ-Z data-wc=13>And what about <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Queen Margrethe's abdication</a>? Was it truly written in the stars?</p><p id=emtD-wX6XTS data-wc=55>"Even for a dominant, quick-fire Aries like Queen Margrethe, her all-conquering decision was breathtaking. What made her do it?" Debbie said. "At age 84, Uranus makes its return to the place it was in at birth and with Queen Margrethe approaching her 84th birthday she was well aware of the need to make radical changes. &nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Royal exclusive</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The real reason Queen Margrethe of Denmark chose to abdicate now" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1e4d43ed44c7-gettyimages-962627718.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The real reason Queen Margrethe of Denmark chose to abdicate now" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The real reason Queen Margrethe of Denmark chose to abdicate now</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eH5dyoawADp data-wc=17>"Coupled with this, Pluto is opposing Pluto in her chart, another marker point with an end-of-an-era feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDBunwuFpwR data-wc=39>"She couples stealth tactics with her Aries assertive and forceful will.
