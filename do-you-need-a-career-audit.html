But, it can be invaluable, says Glynn-Smith. “An audit can provide you with some self-awareness, so that hopefully, you get some clarity about where you are now, what you want more of, and what you might need to address in order to get it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’ve decided a career audit is for you, what’s the best way to get started? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-most-effective-tools-conducting-career#swot-analysis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LinkedIn recommends" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">LinkedIn recommends</a> doing a ‘SWOT’ (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis in relation to your goals – identifying what you’re good at, what you need to work on, external factors that could enhance your prospects, and negatives that could hinder your progress.

A downloadable PDF self-assessment, it takes around an hour to complete and is designed to help you to take stock, identify opportunities, pin-point development areas and guide you through creating a plan of action that really works. “It was inspired by hundreds of hours of coaching experience and working with people who want more from their careers,” she says. “It’s designed for professionals who want to take a more active role in their career development – and, ultimately, their goals – outside what their companies may offer.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Self-awareness is key to growth and leadership, and ultimately happiness and success"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At just £35, the tool is much more affordable than one-to-one coaching sessions, but Glynn-Smith also offers a one-hour follow-up session at a reduced cost if you want to work through your ideas with a professional. “Self-awareness is key to growth and leadership, and ultimately happiness and success,” she says. “We fall into a job because we did something at university, and then that became our career – but we don’t often stop to ask ourselves whether this is really aligned to our strengths, skills or values. So many people reach a point where they recognise that the career path they are on is no longer serving them, or bringing them the fulfilment that it once did. This is where a career audit comes in, to get you back on track.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, if you’re feeling more adrift than you are inspired as you head into the office this week, consider a career audit – it might just be the key to turning your work life around.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jo Glynn-Smith's career audit tool is available to download <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.joglynnsmith.com/career-audit data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=here class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">here</a>, with 20 per cent off for Bazaar readers for a limited time using the code BAZAAR20.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwvMSop6WdXaWus8DInqpompGvrqK%2BjJqrZq%2Bfp7hwrZNva2xtZmWFcK%2FAq5yeql2WwqW102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./captain-munnerlyn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Captain Munnerlyn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
