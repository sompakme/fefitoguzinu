The comparisons began as far back as April 23, 2023, when Henson and Grosvenor announced their engagement; now, as June 7 approaches, that day is shaping up to be “the society wedding of the decade,” Joseph asserted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UCoSFb2N6pKXYy37gKg3zc-1920-80.jpg><p>Their upbringing was quite similar, as both women grew up with two siblings, a brother and a sister, in the Home Counties. (Kate grew up in the Berkshire villages of Bradfield Southend and Bucklebury, and Henson was raised 30 miles away in Longworth.) Both attended the exclusive Marlborough, where, if you’re wondering, fees will cost you £15,665 per term. “And Olivia’s lineage is even more aristocratic than Kate’s, too,” Joseph continued, adding “Even their family history is not dissimilar.” Kate’s mother, Carole, is related to the aristocratic Bowes-Lyons, the family of the late Queen Mother, and Kate is descended from 17th century nobleman Sir William Blakiston and his wife, Jane. (In fact, Joseph reported, Kate and her husband, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-william/>Prince William</a>, are actually 12th cousins once removed through the Blakiston lineage.)</p><p>Henson, too, “has aristocratic pedigree as well as royal connections,” Joseph wrote. “She is the elder daughter of Rupert Henson and his wife Caroline, who is a scion of the Hoare banking family and the Marquess of Bristol.” (Heck, even their mothers have similar names—Carole and Caroline.) Henson is also a descendant of John Manners, the 5th Duke of Rutland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5K2tMGgBV83icBYEgSZG8-1920-80.jpg><p>Come Friday, Henson herself will be a duchess—becoming the next Duchess of Westminster upon her wedding at Chester Cathedral. William will be an usher at the ceremony, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-george/>Prince George</a>, who is the godson of the groom, is expected to be a pageboy.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a>, also a good friend of Grosvenor, will not be attending, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-skips-duke-of-westminster-wedding/><u>Marie Claire</u> </a>reported earlier today, nor will King Charles, the groom’s godfather, as the King will have been in Normandy the day prior to lead commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landing. Kate, unfortunately, will also not be in attendance, as she continues to receive cancer treatment.</p><p>As for Harry specifically, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/prince-harry-declined-invitation-duke-of-westminster-wedding-understanding-between-two-friends-8657860 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>People</u> </a>confirmed that the Duke of Sussex was invited to the Duke of Westminster’s wedding—Grosvenor is, after all, also godfather to Harry’s eldest, Prince Archie, in addition to being godfather to George—but that Harry declined as a part of an “understanding between the two friends.” While Harry reportedly sends “his love and support and admiration for the couple,” his attendance would have been complicated, not the least of which is his still tempestuous relationship with William.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Of their decision to move away from London after their wedding, Henson told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a60722122/duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-olivia-henson-photos/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Town & Country</u></a> “It’s obviously a place where we will live, where we’ll be building our lives together. And we’re slowly transitioning to move up from London and be much more permanent here and really putting roots down. So actually, yes, it was a really easy decision in the end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOsJ%2BoZZmoerC4yK%2BgmmWYmru0u81mna6spaeybrDUnJ%2Beq6NivKd51p6qraWZo8C1sdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-isabella-rose-giannulli-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Isabella Rose Giannulli?
