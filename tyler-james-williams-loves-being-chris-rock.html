Photo / Reuters</p><h3 class=article__subheading--small>KEY POINTS:</h3><p>It's not just the big brown eyes - it's the big brown eyebrows that give Tyler James Williams such an expressive face.</p><p>"I've heard that all my life," says the star of <i>Everybody Hates Chris</i>. "I was always pulling faces at home and if someone said something that I think is odd I'd pull a funny face. I've never used it to my advantage though."</p><p>Starring on a hit show has meant he hasn't been home for a long time anyway. At just 14, he's living a dream life in Los Angeles (his family are in New York), getting comedy tips from the likes of Whoopi Goldberg and <i>Seinfeld's</i> Jason Alexander, guest stars on the show's second series.</p><p>Goldberg plays his neighbour and Alexander, his school principal. "They've taught me a lot about comedy, how to deliver my lines," says Williams. "And the one thing I've realised is how hard comedy acting is. It's not just about how to say something, it's about the timing."</p><p>Last year, Williams branched out to the big screen, starring in the kids' comedy flop, <i>Unaccompanied Minors</i>, a "relaxed" experience compared with the show, he says, because he wasn't in every scene.</p><p>He's still in relaxation mode, enjoying a week off. His family have travelled from New York to LA to spend it with him.</p><p>"I haven't seen them in six months," he says. "But this series has actually been a lot more relaxed, because the first series we were trying to make ourselves known, to get ourselves out there."</p><p><i>Everybody Hates Chris</i> didn't just get out there - it charmed the pants off viewers and critics and was lauded as one of last year's best new series.</p><p>The family friendly comedy is based on comedian Chris Rock's childhood, has an unconventional format without canned laughter, and is narrated by the comedian himself.</p><p>Playing a version of a real person was intimidating at first but Williams says he gained confidence by putting his own spin on the role.</p><p>"I didn't know anything about the character, which made it easier ... I know that sounds strange but no one knew Chris Rock when he was 13. So I could mould it and make it my own."</p><p>You might not laugh out loud in every episode but you're bound to smile in recognition as Rock pulls a Fred Savage and narrates his often hapless existence as a boy, albeit an altered one (he actually has seven siblings).</p><p>The TV Chris is the oldest, so he's responsible for looking after younger brother, Drew, a budding ladies' man; and little sister Tonya, Daddy's princess.</p><p>The parents, Rochelle and Julius are hard-working, strict and often cruel to Chris - to be kind.</p><p>"It's refreshing," says Williams. "It's a family show. It's not too adult for the kids and it's not too kiddie for the adults.</p><p>"It's not a reality show, it's real life. My family is so much like them. My mom is just like Rochelle and my dad is just like Julius. I'm actually the serious one in the family."</p><p>Williams' first role was on <i>Sesame Street</i>. Even 10 years on, the experience is still fresh in his mind.</p><p>"I found myself thinking more about it than I thought I would. Big Bird and all the characters would stay in character if there were new kids but if the older kids were around they would take the masks off and talk to us about acting. I think every kid's first job should be on <i>Sesame Street</i>."</p><p>He has had guest roles on <i>Law & Order: SVU</i> and voice work in the animated film, <i>The Ant Bully</i>.</p><p>Ask him how he relates to his character's everyday drudgery after a lifetime in front of the camera and he's vehement that it's not a stretch. Also, his mother sounds very nice.</p><p>"People think that just because I started acting at a young age that I'm not normal or that I'm not even a human being, that I didn't lead a normal life. I still went on the bus to school, just like everyone else."</p><p>So what happens when Williams grows up? Already his voice is breaking. Obviously there will be more material to mine, thanks to Rock's teenage years, although it might have to screen later at night.</p><p>Williams says he has plans to reach his 100th episode so that could mean staying on the show for another three years.</p><p>"This is my family. This is where I love to be."</p><p><b>Lowdown</b></p><p>What: <i>Everybody Hates Chris</i><br>When: Saturday, TV3, 7.30pm</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBurjEq2SjmZ2awG7DyKWjopmdqHqtu9WeqmaalZ67qHnCoamiq12nvKS3jnx9a210i3%2BOoLKKgoGQgHagl6Kxgo%2BShX2KfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-80-attitude-quotes-for-facebook-status-splendid-collection.html><span>←</span><span>Top 80 attitude quotes for Facebook status: Splendid collection</span></a>
