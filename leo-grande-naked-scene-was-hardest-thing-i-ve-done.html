I can’t just stand there. Why would I do that, it’s horrifying,” said the 61-year-old, noting that people weren’t used to seeing “untreated bodies” on screen. “But that’s the problem, isn’t it, that women have been brainwashed all lives to hate our bodies. That’s just the fact. And everything that surrounds us reminds us how imperfect we are, and everything is wrong with us.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Thompson urged the people in the room to try standing in front of a mirror and not move, to “just accept” and “not judge” what they see. “It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do,” she said. “So I really did something I’ve never done as an actor.”</p><p>In <i>Good Luck to You, Leo Grande</i>, Thompson’s character Nancy hopes to fulfil unfilled sexual gratification having not experienced an orgasm her entire life, something that the actress said didn’t feel remotely unrealistic for women.</p><p>“It’s not considered important that we have pleasure,” she said. “I’m sure I’ve met people who’ve had that experience. Some of the young women I know say they were 30 when they first experienced it. But I don’t think we talk about it, and I also think we’re kind of dishonest about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKa5zJpkraCfor20u81mpa6clWLApLHNnmSwp52au26u0Zqgp6%2BRqLWmsIybpp2hlah6o7HRpaCnZWJlf3N5kGtqbmhpZ4N1f44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zach-miller-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Zach Miller Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
