During a press conference at <a class=hm-link href=#>Wimbledon</a>, the two-time winner of the Australian Open spoke about her latest match, saying: "I had to be here the whole day, which, for a new mum, is a little tough. Hopefully I won't play like this again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa19257c4143-victoria-azarenka-3-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ecZ_A1JhlpTh data-wc=7><strong>Baby Leo accompanied his mum to training</strong></p><p id=eB1IRT80xWLT data-wc=144>The 27-year-old recently shared a gorgeous snap of her six-month-old son, Leo, who joined her during one of her training sessions. Dressed in a striped baby grow and a hat, the baby boy was chewing a badge while his mum can be spotted playing tennis in the background, and Victoria captioned the sweet snap: "I guess my practice is not as interesting as eating your first credential ever! Leo decided to make it to Aorangi park just to chill on a beautiful grass on a sunny day! Will keep all white outfit for next week. #bringyourbabytoworkday." Fans were quick to praise the photo, with one writing: "Oh my God what a cute pic! So lovely! Good luck on the tournament, Vika," while another added: "Proof women can have kids and still be high level performance athletes. Excellent role model. All the best at #Wimbledon."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cf7029d5113-victoria-azarenka-4-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eZgH6KlRYyy1 data-wc=5><strong>Victoria welcomed Leo in December</strong></p><p id=e-lU7xXFg8xd data-wc=106>Although former World number one took Leo to her training session, she revealed that he was absent for her first match at Wimbledon. "It's tough to know what time I was going to play, and this is way past his bedtime," she said. "So I wouldn't do that to him." Victoria regularly shares photos of her baby son on Instagram, and recently posted a snap of herself playing with him in a swimming pool during a trip to Mallorca. She wrote: "After practice I get to do this #blessed quality time with #KingLeo. Loving the pool, not a fan of cold water though just like me."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
