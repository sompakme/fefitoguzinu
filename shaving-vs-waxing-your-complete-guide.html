And which should you choose?</p><p>To learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of waxing vs. shaving, we turned to dermatologists <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://affderm.com/team/karan-lal/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Dr. Karan Lal,</u></a> a dermatologist at Affiliated Dermatology, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Joshua Zeichner</a>, a New York City-based dermatologist, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/drkenhowe/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Kenneth Howe</a>, a dermatologst at UnionDerm.

With waxing, you apply a layer of warm or cold wax right to your skin. This adheres to the hair, and right when it’s stuck you quickly remove it so the hair is tugged out from the root. You’ll probably be hair-free for three to six weeks after a wax and will find your hair growing back finer and softer over time.</p><p>Meanwhile, shaving utilizes a manual or electric <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32854890/best-razors-for-women/>razor</a> with sharp blades to cut your hair right at the skin’s surface. While it’s quick, painless, and wildly convenient (find a razor at any drugstore or hotel front desk) your results will only last one to three days and you might feel like hair is coarser growing back, likely due to the sharp tip where it was severed.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>As far as pain goes, waxing is definitely the worse of the two—unless you accidentally cut yourself or get an ingrown hair in the shaving process.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-waxing-vs-shaving-how-it-works><span>Waxing vs. Shaving: How It Works</span></h2><p>First things first—do you actually know how these methods remove the hair on your body?</p><p>“Shaving removes hair at an angle on the surface of your skin,” says Dr. Lal. The closer the shave, the shorter your hair is being trimmed. Shaper, newer razors are the most hygienic way to do this and will provide you with the smoothest results.</p><p>Unlike shaving, which trims the hair down to the skin or close to it, waxing removes hair by pulling the each strand out from the follicle. You can use either large or small wax strips (here are the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32464467/best-waxing-kits/>best waxing kits</a>) for your desired level of precision.</p><p>Keep reading for a deep dive into both methods, pros and cons included.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-shaving><span>Shaving</span></h2><p>Shaving is maybe the most common at-home hair removal technique. You can find everything you need to get going—including the best <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32854890/best-razors-for-women/><u>razors</u></a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g36079721/best-bikini-trimmers/><u>bikini trimmers</u></a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-shaving-cream-for-women/><u>shaving creams</u></a>—at your local drugstore.

For instance, it's better to shave your face at home<strong> </strong>than use wax strips because shaving causes less irritation. Both shaving and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a23031697/what-is-dermaplaning/>dermaplaning</a> lightly exfoliate the skin, so it’s important to hydrate your skin immediately following shaving. (If you're interested in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a35712226/dermaplaning-at-home/>dermaplaning at home</a>, check out Marie Clare's guide on the topic.)</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-preparation><span>Preparation</span></h3><p>When you shave is just as important as how you shave. Consider this a formal service announcement to never dry shave, which can cause more irritation and will put you at higher risk for cutting yourself as you go. Instead, Dr. Zeichner recommends “shaving at the end of your shower, or after your shower, when the hair and the skin is softened from the water" and says to always use a shave gel or cream.</p><p>Why, you ask? Shaving creams act as a barrier between the skin and the blade, so using one will help you avoid cutting yourself as you go. One more dermatologist-approved shaving tip courtesy of Dr. Zeichner: “Try not to tap the blades against the sink as this can disrupt the polymers that caught the blades themselves."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Eos Shea Better 24h Moisture Shave Cream" data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/shea-better-24h-moisture-shave-cream-xlsImpprod6410050?sku=2272638" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2272638&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fshea-better-24h-moisture-shave-cream-xlsImpprod6410050%3Fsku%3D2272638&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8DAuUQmnBffoAduMNS9oTQ-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Eos Shea Better 24h Moisture Shave Cream</p><a href=# data-model-name="Maude Shave - Moisturizing Shave Oil" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/maude-shave-moisturizing-shave-oil-P505732? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmaude-shave-moisturizing-shave-oil-P505732%3F&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yqbZgRKLBcKi87DzRXMJMW-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Maude Shave - Moisturizing Shave Oil</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-aftercare><span>Aftercare</span></h3><p>Hydration is key after shaving.

Finally, always make sure to carefully read the instructions on the product you’re using.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-length-of-hair><span>Length of Hair</span></h3><p>Unlike shaving, hair needs to be a particular length for waxing to be effective. Dr. Howe previously told Marie Claire in a guide on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/how-to-use-wax-strips/#section-how-long-should-your-hair-be-for-wax-strips-to-be-effective><u>how to use wax strips</u></a> that “this sweet spot is six millimeters, or about the length of a grain of rice.” If the hair is shorter than that, Dr. Howe says that the wax fails to grab the hair. If the hair is longer than that, "the hair shafts often break instead of being pulled out at the root."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-areas-of-the-body><span>Areas of the Body</span></h3><p>While shaving might be great for your face or legs, waxing is better for other areas on the skin that require more precision or are more prone to razor burn or nicks. Think hard-to-reach-places: “The private areas and skin folds—armpits, bikini, buttock—are best for waxing,” says Dr. Lal.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-aftercare><span>Aftercare</span></h3><p>Similar to shaving, hydration is the most important thing after removing your hair. Following up with a rich body cream or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g34932365/best-body-oils/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-body-oils/>body oil</a> can soothe the area. Again, look out for one that's unscented or that's designed to be extra calming.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-waxing-vs-shaving-risks><span>Waxing vs. Shaving Risks</span></h2><p>If comfort is your top priority, shaving is your best option.</p><p>“The biggest side effects of shaving are cuts or nicks in the skin, as well as razor burn,” says Dr. Zeichner, who defines the latter as “a condition where the skin becomes irritated and inflamed, because of the blade causing trauma to the outer skin layer.” However, he also says that both of these problems can be can be minimized with proper technique.</p><p>Still, if you’re sick of razor burn and bumps, waxing can help—and provide hairless results that last longer. Nevertheless, waxing anywhere on your body comes with its own slew of side effects. The biggest issue to be aware of? Waxing generally hurts more than shaving does. Dr. Zeichner says that waxing “can lead to skin irritation from the wax strip against the skin, especially if you’re using hot wax.” And while issues like mild infections in the hair follicles (folliculitis) and ingrown hairs can occur with any hair removal technique, Dr. Zeichner says that the latter can be more common when waxing a certain area of the body.</p><p>“When waxing, the new edge of a hair needs to clear the outer skin layer. Because of this, there is a higher likelihood that this does not happen properly and you develop an ingrown,” he explains.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-waxing-vs-shaving-how-long-it-lasts><span>Waxing vs. Shaving: How Long It Lasts</span></h2><p>Waxing requires you to pull out the hair from the follicle, so it will take longer for that hair to grow back. Dr. Lal says that results can last “up to three weeks.” However, take into account that you’ll have to wait longer once the hair grows back—until it reaches that ideal grain-of-rice length—before waxing again.</p><p>On the other hand, shaving simply trims down the hair rather than removing it from the follicle. Thus, it will take less time for the hair to grow back and become visible again. Dr. Lal says that results from shaving generally last “three to five days.” (But we've all felt the sadness of seeing a little stubble the day after an everything shower, right?)</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet The Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7diJDeNSJvBEaSjLnPjSvH-1920-80.jpg><span class=person__name>Dr. Karan Lal</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board-Certified Dermatologist at Affiliated Dermatology<p>Originally from New York City, he grew up in Queens and attended Hunter Science High School in Manhattan.
