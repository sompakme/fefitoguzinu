With a global audience spanning in the millions, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that other wrestling promotions would want to partner with WWE. However, WWE has also been independent of any external partnerships.</p><p>However, recent reports have emerged that indicate WWE may be looking to work together with Game Change Wrestling. The <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> has pointed out that something is going on between WWE and GCW while also mentioning that Joey Janela promoted this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW and asked everyone on the GCW roster to do the same.</p><p>Brett Lauderdale issued a statement to <a href=#>WrestlingInc</a> but didn’t disclose specific details. Instead, he teased that a major announcement can be expected soon.</p><p>“Of course, we are aware of the speculation and the rumors surrounding GCW right now. We are very excited for the future of GCW, which includes a number of exciting partnerships as well as a game-changing announcement in regards to how people will be able to stream and watch GCW events going forward! We will make our first of many announcements this Saturday during GCW’s event in Detroit, which will air LIVE on FiteTV!”</p><p>Joey Janela continued with his series of WWE-related tweets. The first tweet teased major WrestleMania weekend news that was expected to be announced this week. The second tweet promoted this week’s SmackDown as well as WWE Crown Jewel. We will have to see if these are just teases done to gain some publicity or if there is really a partnership in the works between the two promotions.</p><p>Check Joey Janela’s tweets below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think the announcement could be?
