Hamada is the former head of DC Films who rose through the ranks at New Line, where he oversaw the Warner Bros. division’s horror movies, including The Conjuring and It franchises. His 18hz banner is focused on making features <a href=#>in the horror genre</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And Last Ronin is about as terrifying as a Turtles tale can get. Set in a totalitarian future New York City, the comic miniseries told of how the Turtles and master Splinter are killed off one by one, by the grandson of the villainous Shredder and synthetic ninjas. One Turtle manages to survive, barely, and vows to exact bloody vengeance. One trick of the book was that it wasn’t clear, for a while at least, which one of the Turtles lived, as the survivor had the weapons of all four.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Co-creator Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz wrote the comic based on an older story by Eastman and co-creator Peter Laird. Artists included Esau and Isaac Escorza, Ben Bishop and Eastman.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">IDW, the publisher that holds the license for the Ninja Turtles comics, put out the books between 2020 and 2022. The comics were an unexpected massive hit, with the collected trade paperback being the <a rel=nofollow href=#>second-highest-selling graphic novel</a> of 2023, per Circana BookScan.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The comic book company recently released the sequel TMNT: The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution, with the debut issue touted as being one of the biggest comics of the year, with more than 140,000 copies ordered.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Ninja Turtles debuted as a black-and-white indie comic in 1984, parodying comics like Chris Claremont’s X-Men comics and Frank Miller’s ninja-focused work. A toy deal turned the comic into a generational touchstone in the late 1980s, abetted by a bright and cheerful animated series, followed by a hit live-action movie wherein the Turtles were <a href=#>played by actors in suits</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Over the years, more animated series came at audiences like twirling nunchucks while Paramount, which landed the rights to the property via Viacom in 2009, put out two live-action movie produced by <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-bay data-tag=michael-bay>Michael Bay</a> that starred Megan Fox and Will Arnett in the mid-2010s.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mutant Mayhem, produced by Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, brought back a respectable sheen to the property by giving it a cool outsider point a view. Critics and audiences liked what the saw, with the animated movie grossing over $118.6 at the domestic box office. A sequel is now in the works.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">IDW is also relaunching a mainline Ninja Turtles comic series timed to the title’s 40th anniversary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Smith is repped by WME and Grandview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLWxxKeYoJ1dosK1rc2tZKehnp%2BubsDUq6ulnaNiuaK%2F02apqKaZo3quu9WinGZpYmiCeYOQbXBsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-quinn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Quinn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
