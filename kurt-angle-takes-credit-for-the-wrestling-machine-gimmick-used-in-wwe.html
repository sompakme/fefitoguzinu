He gained favor with the likes of Vince McMahon, earning his trust in the process. It appears that McMahon was responsible for his ‘Wrestling Machine’ gimmick as well.</p><p>The Olympic Gold Medallist earned several accolades throughout his career, including becoming a multi-time World Champion. Angle has also faced many legendary pro wrestlers in his career, which includes the likes of The Rock, The Undertaker and more.</p><p>In 2006, Kurt Angle debuted what arguably became his best gimmick, as he was simply known as the ‘Wrestling Machine’ and had a series of stellar matches with every WWE Superstar under the sun.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Kurt Angle Show Podcast</a>, the WWE Hall Of Famer talked about the origins of his ‘Wrestling Machine’ character and revealed that it all started because of a talk with Vince McMahon.</p><p>“I came up with it. Vince McMahon came to me and said, ‘Listen, we need to stop doing the funny stuff. I want you to be taken more seriously.’ I said, ‘Yeah, that’s fine. What do you want from me?’ He said, ‘I just want a really intense Kurt Angle.’ I said, ‘How about The Wrestling Machine?’ He said, ‘That’s a good idea.’ So that’s how it all started. It was my idea, and I ran with it. Yeah, it worked out really well. Unfortunately, it didn’t last that long because I wasn’t in WWE long after that, but for the very beginning in ECW, it worked.”</p><p>Kurt Angle also&nbsp;<a href=#>regretted not having huge merchandise sales like Steve Austin and John Cena</a>. He also recently turned down a&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE Draft appearance</a>. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Angle as a WWE return could happen in the future.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what Kurt Angle said? Did you love his ‘Wrestling Machine’ persona?
