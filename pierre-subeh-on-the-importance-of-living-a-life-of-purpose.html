With <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">X Network</a>, Pierre Subeh has worked with several notable brands including Starbucks, Apple, Abbott Laboratories, and Pepsi. He is experienced in creating new successful ventures and a natural leader in managing teams. Pierre started building businesses at a young age. He was the owner of a 6-figure business at the age of 17. He has scaled various businesses and earned recognition globally.

At 22, Pierre has made it his mission in life to work for the cause of equality and represent his heritage in western society. He has come up with a unique approach to push his agenda by using technology and marketing for positive change.</p><p class=align-left>His recent campaign to push for the recognition of April as the National Arab American Heritage Month (NAAHM) was a success achieving what the Arab American Foundation has failed to achieve for decades. In the campaign, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pierre</a> used over 250 billboards spread around the country to showcase the Middle-Eastern Heritage and urge the Federal government to recognize April as the National Arab American Heritage Month. His efforts bore fruits as President Biden responded in a public letter acknowledging his teams' efforts and praised them for bringing to the fore the Middle-Eastern Culture.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/420983283382dee7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You will never believe what DMX net worth is!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>To Pierre, the campaign marks a new dawn of social change through business and marketing circles. He has confirmed the continued support from his marketing firm for progressing the cause of Arab Americans. He believes that everyone has a role to play in society and it's upon you to challenge yourself to do the things that would be beneficial for your community.</p><p class=align-left>According to him, living a life with purpose is not necessarily the easiest thing to do but always leads to more satisfaction and happiness. No matter how hard the current generation thinks that making a positive social impact is complicated and unnecessary, it remains essential.</p><p class=align-left>Pierre believes that no matter how much you earn, your position in society, or the friends supporting your journey, it can never match living a life with a purpose. Knowing that you have made a positive impact in society comes with a natural, fulfilling, and motivating feeling that drives you to achieve tremendous success in life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2ghf1so8jon.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the name of the youngest president in Africa?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Pierre implies that by striving to create a positive social impact, you will be doing good to others and the reward is more motivation to accomplish more in life.</p><p class=align-left>Pierre is currently working on releasing his new book.
