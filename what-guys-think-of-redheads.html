See below:</p><p><strong>"The redheaded stepchild" is the outcast.&nbsp;</strong>There are fewer redheads, so maybe that's why I haven't dated one. Despite their distinct appearance, they aren't discussed in male circles as much as blondes and brunettes.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3348/four-visual-deal-breakers-090703/>I've heard guys say red hair is a deal breaker</a>.</p><p><strong>The classic redhead women are strikingly beautiful:</strong>&nbsp;Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn. For me, the redhead personality consists of polar opposites: She's either the beer-swilling barmaid, giving every guy a run for his money...or the classic confident beauty, understated and graceful, possessing all the answers before everyone else.</p><p><strong>Redheads are "fiery lasses."</strong>&nbsp;Redheads are bubbly blondes&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3763/control-in-love/>with a "I'll kick your butt if you step out of line" brunette streak.</a>&nbsp;Like brunettes, redheads can be intimidating, but in a different way — more like a brazen confidence.</p><p>The eyes may actually have it.&nbsp;Eye color sometimes mixes with hair color amazingly: blue eyes with dark hair, brown eyes with blonde, and green with, well, any hair color. It's funny how culture and media influence perception of hair color, but my personal opinion is: It doesn't matter what color your hair is;&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2943/personality-over-looks/>if you're hot, you're hot</a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
