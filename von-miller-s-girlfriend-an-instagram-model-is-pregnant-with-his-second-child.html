But now things have changed.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>A controversial and intense relationship</h2><p>After that, Miller called her a "terrible mother" on IG, and said <strong>she would not allow him to be a part of her child's birth or life</strong>. A toxic relationship like thousands. That's when they both started dating other people,<strong> but something happened that things started to get better.</strong></p><p>So much that now <strong>Denise announced that she is pregnant again with the one-time MVP</strong> of Super Bowl 50: "Another year, another blessing. 2-9-2023. This year my day is about you bubba. <strong>Made the same baby twice. 9 weeks left to hold you VICTORIA B'VSEAN MILLER,</strong>" he wrote on his Instagram.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Miller will have time to be with her and be a good father</h2><p>While the time comes for the birth, Von Miller will have time to dedicate to his partner and be with his daughter, <strong>as he hurt his knee and has a torn ACL, so he will not play with the Bills for the rest of the season.</strong></p><p>Von Miller is in his first year with the Bills, after winning the Super Bowl the previous season <strong>with the Los Angeles Rams. </strong>Miller's arrival in Buffalo was supposed to be instrumental in the Bills finally making it to the Super Bowl, <strong>so it remains to be seen how much his absence will affect the team.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeSqrOnrcuoZJuhnKHAcH6Pa2loaWJkfXl7lWxwam9lbbCmfpZpa55sZGh%2Fea6TbnByZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-dickson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Dickson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
