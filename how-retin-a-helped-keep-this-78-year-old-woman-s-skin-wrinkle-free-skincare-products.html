She sure is aging gracefully! I hope this would be me too when I am older."<br></p><p>So basically, every single person should be using a retinoid (so long as your skin isn't crazy sensitive, like&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a29199/living-with-rosacea/>anyone with rosacea</a>) if you care about boosting your skin's health.
