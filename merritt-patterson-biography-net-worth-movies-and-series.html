While we have no details of her childhood or early education, we do know that she and her sister, Mackenzie, were single-handedly raised by their father, Dave Patterson.&nbsp;Considering her incredible talent and acting sense, we want to make every effort to list her academic qualifications and educational portfolio.&nbsp;So far, however, this has been a search in a haystack.&nbsp;To make it short;&nbsp;We don’t have tabs for these details yet.&nbsp;Heck, why does she care about her qualifications?&nbsp;Patterson isn’t running for public office, is he?&nbsp;So let’s save the ‘edu-talk’ for another and see how well she did as an actress.&nbsp;Should we?</span></p><p><span>Growing up, Merritt Patterson developed an aptitude for the showbiz industry.&nbsp;At the age of eleven she appeared in dance competitions and theater productions.&nbsp;Her talent blossomed so well during her high school days that she landed a role in a commercial for the UN.&nbsp;She was only fifteen then.&nbsp;Patterson was also featured in a TV commercial for the Roger Touch Phones.&nbsp;In addition, she switched lanes into modeling for a while.</span></p><p><span>Already in 2006 she was part of the Canadian Herbal Essence Teen Model search;&nbsp;where she beat ten thousand other candidates.&nbsp;However, her modeling prospects were reportedly thwarted by her lack of height.&nbsp;At 5ft 5in, Patterson did not meet the height requirements for popular modeling standards.&nbsp;She did not give up and again focused her creative energies on acting.&nbsp;She became more aware when she moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles, California to pursue an acting career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Movies and TV Shows</span></strong></h2><p><span>Merritt Patterson debuted in 2006 with a guest starring role as Ashleigh Redmond on the popular family TV series Kyle XY.&nbsp;Three years later, she landed her film role as Jessica in the 2009 film,&nbsp;</span><span>The Hole</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Since that time, Patterson has appeared on several TV shows including;&nbsp;</span><span>Supernatural</span><span>&nbsp;(2009),&nbsp;</span><span>Life Unexpectedly</span><span>&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;</span><span>The Troupe</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>Iron Intruder</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>Disney’s Radio Rebel</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Pregnancy Project</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Motive</span><span>&nbsp;(2016),&nbsp;</span><span>A Winter Royal</span><span>&nbsp;(2017),&nbsp;</span><span>Bad Date Chronicles</span><span>&nbsp;(2017),&nbsp;</span><span>The Christmas Cottage</span><span>&nbsp;(2017),</span><span>March 4th Wedding: Something Old</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Something New</span><span>&nbsp;(2018) and&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas at the Palace</span><span>&nbsp;(2018).</span></p><p><span>Apart from that, she has leading roles in popular series like&nbsp;</span><span>Ravenswood</span><span>&nbsp;(2013-2014), Ophelia Price in&nbsp;</span><span>The Royal Ones</span><span>&nbsp;(2015) and as Olivia Brukner in&nbsp;</span><span>The Art of More</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).&nbsp;More so, Patterson has acted in several popular films including&nbsp;</span><span>Percy Jackson & the Olympians: Lightning Thief</span><span>&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;</span><span>Next Door Nightmare</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>Revel</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Rufus</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Primary</span><span>&nbsp;(2014),&nbsp;</span><span>Wolves</span><span>&nbsp;(2014) ,&nbsp;</span><span>Kid Cannabis</span><span>&nbsp;(2014).&nbsp;In 2018, she starred as Cynthia in&nbsp;</span><span>Unbroken: Path to Redemption</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Merritt Patterson’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Salary and Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>As of 2019, sources reveal Merritt Patterson’s net worth of $1.5 million.&nbsp;Much of it stems from her fledgling acting career.&nbsp;Although there are no details on how much she makes annually, her past success can give us a clue.&nbsp;Her involvement in the 2010 film&nbsp;</span><span>Percy Jackson & the Olympians</span><span>&nbsp;gave her a fair cut of the over $226.4 million the film grossed at the box office.&nbsp;Although a budget of $ 95 million.</span></p><p><span>There are also no verified details of Patterson’s investment portfolio or what properties are on her real estate listing.&nbsp;Especially things like their houses, car collection and luxury items.&nbsp;At best, all that can be said is that the 20-year-old lives a lavish lifestyle.</span></p><h2><strong><span>height and body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>For a woman in her late twenties, Merritt Patterson still maintains that graceful slim figure.&nbsp;She is 1.65 meters tall and weighs 61 kg.&nbsp;She has dark brown hair and blue eyes.&nbsp;As of this writing, Patterson measures 37-26-37 inches across his chest, waist, and hips.&nbsp;She also has a shoe and dress size of US 7 and US 8, and a bra size 34C.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
